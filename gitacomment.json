                        "Before beginning this commentary, I would like to point out that reading any English-only translation of the Gita, however good, will only be skimming the surface. This is because of the many meanings of Sanskrit words–meanings that were in the mind of Vyasa and that were used for that very reason. In the West we have the idea that spiritual texts have but one meaning, and that may be so for Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, but this is not at all the case for Sanskrit texts which are intended to have multi-level messages and subtle nuances. Words which carry several relevant ideas are ideal for the profound wisdom of the Gita and Upanishads, particularly.",
                        "Because of this I recommend that you obtain translations of the Gita that contain the Sanskrit text with word-by-word translations as well as the usual verse form. Sargeant’s translation is deﬁnitely the best for this, but it would be good to have one or two more. In addition you need some Sanskrit dictionaries. The best is A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy by John Grimes. The Yoga-Vedanta Dictionary of Swami Sivananda is also very informative. Our own endeavor, A Brief Sanskrit Glossary, is certainly helpful, though far from the caliber of the ﬁrst two books. Do not bother with the ponderous dictionaries of Monier-Williams. They are simply not worth the trouble, what to say of the expense. A search on the Internet may also uncover some worthwhile dictionaries, but be cautious. They are often posted there by rabid sectarians who distort the deﬁnitions or even omit words to bolster their personal philosophy–which by their very dishonesty is proven to be false and inauthentic.",
                        "It is my hope that you who read these essays will be looking at other translations of the Gita–for it is impossible to produce a deﬁnitive translation of a text written in such a complex language as Sanskrit. I always check at least four translations when looking into the meaning of a verse: those of Swamis Prabhavananda, Swarupananda, and Sivananda, and that of Winthrop Sargeant. I sometimes consult those of Sri Aurobindo, Gandhi, and William Judge, as well."

                        "Most of us have heard the story of the centipede who, when asked how he managed to walk with so many legs, tangled his legs in the attempt to ﬁgure it out and ended up on his back, helpless. This is not unlike the person who attempts to plumb the depths of oriental scriptures. Right away it becomes evident that they consist of incalculable layers, many symbolic in nature. Furthermore, the meanings of the symbols are not consistent, changing according to the levels on which they occur. For example, on one level water symbolizes the mind, on another level the constant ﬂux of samsara, and on another the subtle life-currents known as prana. This being the case, the Western linear mode of thought becomes as entangled and disabled as the fabled centipede. Knowing this to be so, I have decided to avoid subtle symbolism and concentrate instead on the obviously practical side of Krishna’s teachings in the Bhagavad Gita. (For an exposition of the symbolism of the Gita, see Paramhansa Yogananda’s masterpiece of commentary, God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita.) However I do want to take some time and consider the obvious symbolism encountered in the ﬁrst chapter of the Gita.",
                        "We ﬁnd ourselves on Kurukshetra, a ﬁeld of impending battle. It is not as vast as our Hollywoodepic-shaped minds might imagine, as can be seen for oneself by a visit to Kurukshetra, not very far from Delhi. At one end is a hillock topped with a huge tree under which there is a life-sized reproduction in marble of the type of chariot used in the battle. This is the vantage point from which Arjuna, the great warrior, and Sri Krishna looked out over the ﬁeld. Today its tranquillity is charming, despite the strong feeling in the air that something tremendously momentous occurred there in the distant past. It is both awesome and soothing.",
                        "For background information regarding how the battleground came to be thronged with soldiers, chariots, elephants and the other paraphernalia of a deadly war, see the introductory essay, “Gita and Mahabharata” in Swami Prabhavananda’s translation The Song of God.",
                        "Sufﬁce it to say that the two opposing armies are very easy to morally identify. The Kauravas, led by the murderous Prince Duryodhana, are fundamentally evil, although many honorable men have, through various complicated alliances and obligations, found themselves among their ranks. The Pandavas, headed by the virtuous and noble Yudhisthira, the eldest brother of Arjuna, are embodiments of all that is good, among them being the divine Sri Krishna himself who chose to be the charioteer of Arjuna.",
                        "The symbolism is not very hard to ﬁgure out (leaving aside the complex matter of assigning a symbolic meaning to every person named in the battle narrative). Kurukshetra is the personality– particularly the mind (intellect)–of the individual, awakened seeker for higher consciousness. Such a seeker, determined to end the whirling cycle of birth and death, ﬁnds that his aspiration itself has inspired opposition from within his own mind and heart, where good and evil, truth and falsehood, ignorance and wisdom, like the Kauravas and Pandavas, have drawn themselves up in readiness for a conﬂict that must end in the annihilation of one side or the other. Even more daunting is the fact that much considered “good” is found lining up in support of negativity, and most of the “Pandava” side will also be blotted out in the eventual transmutation of the individual into a higher state of being itself, much as the endearing ways of infancy and childhood must be eradicated at the advent of adulthood and replaced with completely different virtues.",
                        "In the chariot set betwixt the two armies we ﬁnd Arjuna and Krishna. Many interpretations of these two pivotal ﬁgures are possible, nearly all of them correct, but the words of the Mundaka Upanishad, written long before the Gita, are certainly worthy of our attention.",
                        "“Like two birds of golden plumage, inseparable companions, the individual self and the immortal Self are perched on the branches of the selfsame tree. The former tastes of the sweet and bitter fruits of the tree; the latter, tasting of neither, calmly observes.",
                        "“The individual self, deluded by forgetfulness of his identity with the divine Self, bewildered by his ego, grieves and is sad. But when he recognizes the worshipful Lord as his own true Self, and beholds his glory, he grieves no more.” (Mundaka Upanishad 3:1:1, 2. This is the translation found in The Upanishads, Breath of the Eternal, by Swami Prabhavananda.)",
                        "These two paragraphs are a perfect summary of the entire Gita. Arjuna is the bewildered and sorrowing atma, the individual self, and Krishna is the divine Paramatma, the Supreme Self from which the atma derives its very being and existence. Forgetful of its true nature as part of the Inﬁnite Spirit, the ﬁnite spirit passes through countless experiences that confuse and pain it, producing utterly false conclusions that compound and perpetuate the confusion and pain. Only when the perspective of the Divine Self is entered into, can its troubles cease. We can also think of Arjuna as our lower mortal self, and Krishna as our higher immortal self. Krishna and Arjuna thus represent both God and Man and our own (presently) dual nature as mortal and immortal. Keeping this perspective before us, the ensuing dialogue which forms the Gita is to be seen both as God’s communication to human beings and the communication of our own divine self with our human self–liberation of the spirit (moksha) being their sole intention.",
                        "With this in mind, we are ready to begin. I will be using the translation of Winthrop Sargeant: The Bhagavad Gita, published by State University of New York Press. This is the best all-round translation, though the translation of Swami Prabhavananda is unparalleled for beauty and interpretation. I recommend both. Sometimes I will use the wording Sargeant lists in his word-by-word analysis rather than that which he uses in the actual translation."

We as individuals are each a dharmic ﬁeld, expressing the actuality of our present level of evolution.",

Not only do negativity and ignorance–the enemies of dharma–dominate society in general, we ﬁnd within ourselves a welter of negative impulses, conﬂicts, confusions, fears, and ignorance of all kinds. Yes; we are deﬁnitely in–and are–the ﬁeld of the Kurus, whatever our intentions may be. We are going to have to ﬁght through the whole ﬁeld and wipe out all the Kurus and most of the Pandavas. Remember, we have lived millions of lives: mineral, plant, animal, and human; and we have brought all the impressions (samskaras) and habits (vasanas) of those lives along with us. Our past is our present. No wonder we are in trouble! But, as Swami Sri Yukteswar often said: “Forget the past. The vanished lives of all men are dark with many shames. Human conduct is ever unreliable until anchored in the Divine. Everything in future will improve if you are making a spiritual effort now.” And the Gita will help us in this effort."

So they both ﬁght with each other–often on the subconscious level. Both are “battle-hungry” for they are ﬁghting for their very life.

Now in the real battle many families were represented on both sides, which is why Sargeant translates Dhritarashtra speaking of “my army and that of the sons of Pandu,” but Vyasa has in the Sanskrit: “my and Pandu’s sons,” indicating that all the Kuru army were his sons, and all those on the Pandava side were sons of Pandu. The purpose of this is to show that all the warriors of ignorance and delusion are children of the blind ego (Dhritarashtra), whereas the the inner soldiers of truth and higher consciousness are the children of the Spirit-Self, the divine Atman.",

There we see Duryodhana as one of the foulest, most evil ﬁgures in recorded history. Many times he attempted to kill the Pandava brothers, whose kingdom he had usurped. He also plotted the death of Krishna several times. He is evil, and Vyasa is going to show this to us by his conversation with Drona, a venerable man who was his teacher, the one who had given him all his education and training as a kshatriya (a member of the warrior-ruling caste). Actually, the whole Gita consists of two conversations: that between Duryodhana and Drona (though it was really a monologue in the style of all egotists) and that between Arjuna and Krishna. Arjuna pleads with Krishna to teach him, but Duryodhana only seeks to set Drona straight and accuse him for also being the teacher of Arjuna who is now facing him as an opponent in battle. So it begins…",

He was all brawn and no brains, but beloved by those who could survive knowing him. He name means “tremendous,” but in the sense of terrifying. All those listed by Duryodhana are maharathas– mighty chariot-warriors who could ﬁght huge numbers of foot-soldiers singlehandedly.",

And mighty Yudhamanyu and valorous Uttamaujas; the son of Subhadra and the sons of Draupadi, all indeed great warriors.” (1:5,6) Well, that tells Drona! (Subhadra was Krishna’s sister. “The sons of Draupadi” are the Pandava brothers, including Arjuna.)",
                              "Even though Drona got Duryodhana into this tangle (egotists always take the credit, even when it is not due them, for success, but always manage to blame someone else for failure), there is no need for worry. “Those of our who are indeed distinguished, know them! O highest of the twiceborn, the leaders of my army I name for you by proper names.” (1:7) As if Drona would not know all of them very well! This is extremely insulting–as is the way of all bullies. The fact that he speaks of “my army” reveals his egotism. “Twiceborn” was a title referring to the three higher of the four castes, referring to their having undergone a spiritual birth through initiation into the Gayatri mantra and the spiritual rites of Vedic religion.",

It is amazing to see how “the world” and the ego devour a person, sapping their life, turning them into aimless husks, and all the while they think they are “really living” “the good life.” This is the fatal illusion in which humans dwell. Only those who have glimpsed the truth of their inner divinity have a chance at escaping the realm of death."

So naturally, those that see only with the bodily eyes would think that their numbers were inadequate. But throughout history great victories have been one by a few–sometimes even by only one. In the Bible (the book of Judges) we ﬁnd that God kept telling Gideon that he had too many soldiers, and ordering that he pare down their numbers. He did so, and they routed a huge number of soldiers without even ﬁghting! It is foolish to think that numbers make either strength or right. But that is the way of Duryodhana and his kind."

Some say he owned the conch that later bore his name, some say that he was a shape-changing demon that lived in the conch (which was under the sea), and others that Krishna made a conch out of his bones. But a great yogi once told me during a conversation in Rishikesh that it is a contracted form of Panchavijaya, which means “Five Victories,” the meaning being that Om brings spiritual victory over the ﬁve elements (bhutas) and mastery of the ﬁve bodies (koshas). Devadatta means “God-given,” since Om is the key to liberation given by God (Ishwara) Himself to human beings. Paundra, the yogi told me, means mighty sound, or “of a mighty sound,” Om being the supreme Word of Power. Anantavijaya means “unending victory,” the effect of the japa and meditation of Om. Sughosha also means “making a great noise,” but the yogi said it also means “making a sweet, soothing sound”–an experience the Om Yogi can attest to. Manipushpaka literally means “jeweled bracelet” or circlet. In verse seven of the seventh chapter we are told that “On Me all this universe is strung like jewels on a thread.” Om is the inner thread on which all existence is strung. But the yogi told me its intended meaning is “mind like a ﬂower,” opened like a lotus at the shining of the light of Om within. It can also mean “aerial chariot of the mind,” because Om causes the mind to open up in and ﬂy in the Sky of Consciousness, the Chidakasha. (See Om Yoga regarding this.)

So the next verse says: “The sound burst asunder the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra, and the tumult caused the sky and the earth to resound.” (1:19) As said, Om resounds throughout the “sky” and “earth” of the yogi, and bursts apart the hearts of all the foes of the",

With whom must I ﬁght in undertaking this battle! I behold those who are about to give battle, having come together here, wishing to do service in warfare for the evilminded son of Dhritarashtra. Thus Krishna was addressed by Arjuna, O Dhritarasthra, having caused the chief chariot to stand in the middle between the two armies.

Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to ﬁnish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, saying, This man began to build, and was not able to ﬁnish.

Sanjaya calls Dhritarashtra Prithivipate: Lord of the Earth, of prithvi, the earth element, the principle of non-sentient material existence. Krishna, though, is called Mahipate: Lord of the Earth (mahi) in the sense of the intelligent world of sentient beings. It is the difference between marble and a marble statue.

Gandiva [his bow] falls from my hand, my skin burns, I am unable to remain as I am, and my mind seems to ramble. I perceive inauspicious omens, O Krishna, and I foresee misfortune in destroying my own people in battle. I do not desire victory, Krishna, nor kingship nor pleasures. What is kingship to us, Krishna? What are enjoyments, even life? Those for whose sake we desire kingship, enjoyments, and pleasures, they are arrayed here in battle, abandoning their lives and riches. Teachers, fathers, sons, and also grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen. I do not desire to kill them who are bent on killing, Krishna, even for the sovereignty of the three worlds, how much less then for the earth? What joy would it be for us to strike down the sons of Dhritarashtra, O Krishna? Evil thus would cling to us, having killed these aggressors. Therefore we are not justiﬁed in killing the sons of Dhritarashtra, our own kinsmen. How, having killed our own people, could we be happy, Krishna? Even if those whose thoughts are overpowered by greed do not perceive the wrong caused by the destruction of the family, and the crime of treachery to friends, why should we not know enough to turn back from this evil, through discernment of the wrong caused by the destruction of the family, O Krishna? In the destruction of the family, the ancient family laws vanish; when the law has perished, lawlessness overpowers the entire family also. Because of the ascendency of lawlessness, Krishna, the family women are corrupted; when women are corrupted, O Krishna, the intermixture of caste is born. Intermixture bring to hell the family destroyers and the family, too; the ancestors of these indeed fall, deprived of offerings of rice and water. By these wrongs of the family destroyers, producing intermixture of caste, caste duties are abolished, and eternal family laws also. Men whose family laws have been obliterated, O Krishna, dwell indeﬁnitely in hell, thus we have heard repeatedly. Ah! Alas! We are resolved to do a great evil, which is to be intent on killing our own people, through greed for royal pleasures. If the armed sons of Dhritarashtra should kill me in battle while I was unresisting and unarmed, this would be a greater happiness for me. Thus having spoken on the battleﬁeld, Arjuna sat down upon the seat of the chariot, throwing down both arrow and bow, with a heart overcome by sorrow.” (1:26-47)",

As already said, when we take stock of the inner conﬂict, we identify with both sides. Thinking that if they are dissolved or destroyed “we” will cease to exist, we are appalled and feel that our very existence is threatened. Then, like all human beings who do not like the truth when they see or hear it, we become “confused” and try to avoid the unpleasant prospect. Bitter as death seems the inner battle, so we shrink from it and desperately try to ﬁnd a way out.",
                              "So does Arjuna. In a lengthy and impassioned monologue he has presented to Krishna his “confusion,” which is really a plea to inaction, to avoidance of conﬂict, thinking that such a negative condition is peace, whereas peace is a positive state, not the mere absence of unrest and conﬂict. It is also reached only through unrest and conﬂict, however little we like the fact.",

Arjuna veils his aversion with words of compassion for others, when in actuality he is the sole object of his “compassion.” He simply does not wish to see others suffer because that will make him suffer–and feel guilty for their suffering. Krishna makes this clear to him. The Stoic, Epictetus, was once visited by a man who told him that he loved his daughter so much he had run from the house rather than see her suffering from illness. Carefully, gently yet ﬁrmly, Epictetus led him to understand that it was his selflove that motivated him, not love for his child. (See the Moral Discourses of Epictetus.)",

Arjuna was both sad and rebellious. Yet Krishna smiled. The word in the Gita is prahasann, which means to smile before laughing.

Krishna smiled for several reasons.",

This reminds me of an incident in the life of Sri Anandamayi Ma. A man came to see her, overwhelmed with grief at a recent personal loss. “Ma will understand my suffering,” he said to himself, “She will realize the extent of my sorrow.” But the moment he entered the room, Ma began laughing merrily, looking at him all the while. “Ma!” he protested, “Seeing how unhappy I am, how can you laugh like that?” “Baba,” Ma replied, “there is now one less obstacle between you and God!” I have witnessed similar incidents with Ma in which her laughter instantly healed the sorrow or anxiety of those who came to her for sympathy.

God is always God, and we are always ourselves. That is how God sees it–and so should we. Nothing we can say, think, or do can possibly change God in any way. If God could be angered or gladdened by us, He would be as ignorant, changeable, and subject to suffering as we are. In fact, we would have more control over Him than He has over us, as we are continually ignoring Him and being indifferent to Him. Our changeability is a myth, too, for all change takes place only in the delusive wrappings of our unchanging spirit (atma, purusha).

When looking through the original Greek texts of the collection of spiritual writings known as the Philokalia, I came across a writing of Saint Gregory that had some diagrams. Not knowing any but the most elementary Greek (little more than the alphabet) I took the volume to a Greek-speaking monk and asked what the article as about. To my amazement he told me that it was an explanation of how the world was ﬂat and how completely irrational and baseless it was to say the world was spherical!

I was not disappointed, for his words are truly inspired and his insights invaluable. But then I came up against a real surprise. His brother, Saint Basil the Great, gave a series of discourses on the days of creation, but died before he could give the ﬁnal sermon. So Saint Gregory decided to complete the work by writing an article on the ﬁnal day of creation. In the article he discusses the human anatomy and for some reason presents a lengthy and complicated explanation of why and how human beings sneeze. The explanation is ingenious–and equally erroneous, not to say genuinely funny. Again, the words were very logical, quite reasonable, but utterly mistaken to the point of silliness.

Just as our spirits transcend time, so our personalities, which are nothing more than masks shaped by our past and present lives, exist only within time and are ever-changing until they are dissolved in the light of spiritual knowledge (jnana). Our personalities are indeed separate from God, and as long as we identify with them we will feel separated from Him and engage in the delusional “search” and “reaching out” for God. I say delusional because our true selves (atmas) are never separate from God. “He is not far from every one of us: for in him we live, and move, and have our being; for we are also his offspring.” (Acts 17:27, 28) Our personalities can never ﬁnd or touch God because they simply do not exist as actual–much less eternal–realities.

Therefore he says: “These bodies are said to come to an end”–to die. They do not die for two reasons. The obvious one is that birth and death are mere appearances. Having never been born “in reality” how could the body die? However, the appearances of birth and death are part of the cosmic drama, part of the Divine Dream known as Pradhana or Prakriti. And interestingly, physics has demonstrated that absolutely not even a particle of an atom is ever destroyed; that every bit that existed/appeared “in the beginning” exists right now–only the arrangements of the particles have changed. This would have to be so. Since the Dreamer is eternal and outside of time, so also must the Dream be in its ultimate reality–for can anything of the Divine be unreal?",

When we understand its nature as a mere dream, a thought, this is the only possible conclusion. It is when we think of it as an actual substance that can come into being and go out of being that we become entangled in error. And it is this error which the Vedantists deny, the seeming conﬂict between Sankhya and Vedanta on this point only occurring in the minds of those who have not experienced the vision behind both philosophies–themselves known as darshanas: viewings.",

Rather, they represent different viewpoints or attitudes toward the same Reality, differing in emphasis, but never in substance. For a person to understand Sanatana Dharma, all six philosophies must be studied. The preference for one over the others should be understood as a manifestation of personal nature (guna and karma–just as with caste) only and not evidence of one being true (or more true) and the others false (or less true).",

What he was saying, actually, was that they possessed “mother’s intuition” and should learn to tap it and act on it. Even the most esoterically and philosophically unsophisticated people continually use expressions that show a subliminal knowledge far beyond their conscious awareness. One thing is the universal habit of referring to our bodies as “mine.” “I broke my leg, “we say, not: “I broke myself.” We all know instinctively that we possess our body, that it is separate from us and is being used only as an instrument. Yes, we identify with it and say things like: “He hit me” when the body was struck, but usually we speak of the body as “mine” rather than “me.” Or we even speak of it in a strange combination such as: “He hit me on the arm.” However mixed these signals may be, the underlying consciousness is that of our being the owner of the body and not the body itself. Yet when we consciously identify ourselves and others with the temporary and the perishable, like Arjuna, we cannot help but be fearful and confused.

Not only is there a sense of hopelessness at the inevitability of death, the bodies are treated as though they are the departed person. In the West we dress them up, put makeup on them, style their hair, and put them in metal boxes with innerspring mattresses (“So they will rest easy,” explained one mortician to a friend of mine.) Grave sites are often chosen with a view the departed (?) will be sure to like. And after burial they are “visited,” given ﬂowers, and often spoken to. In some cultures the families put food on the graves and even have a picnic there to share a meal with the dead. In Cairo, when you go to the pyramids you pass through a vast section of the city that is the City of the Dead, composed of small houses set along a labyrinth of streets. Each house is a tomb. On holidays the families visit these houses and have lunch with the dead–who their religion says are not there at all but in another plane of existence altogether. This is craziness.",

These are the vrittis in the chitta spoken of by Patanjali at the beginning of the Yoga Sutras, the permanent cessation or prevention of which is Yoga. Through meditation we come to separate ourselves from the movie screen of illusion. Learning is the purpose of the movie, so we do not just throw the switch and leave the theater.

                              "Secondly: pierced, burned, wetted, and withered (dried) are symbols of being changed, taken from or added to (increased or decreased). Since we cannot be altered in any way, anything that can be is not ourself. This is the very important teaching known in Sanskrit as anatma–the teaching regarding what is not the self. Buddha emphasized this greatly, and was being completely traditional in doing so. Sadly, those outside India who encountered his teachings thought that the term (anatta in Pali) meant there is no self. But the term means not-self, not no-self, which would be niratma or niratta. So wherever we see change…that is not the self. “Change and decay all around I see. O Thou Who changest not, abide with me.” Unfortunately, these words are addressed God, Who is not the problem. What should be sought is the abiding experience of our own unalterable self. For Krishna sums it up in this way: “This cannot be pierced, burned, wetted or withered; this is eternal, all-pervading, ﬁxed; this is unmoving and primeval.” (2:24)",

Yet it pervades all that we call “us,” enlivening all our body-levels in the same way the proximity of ﬁre creates warmth in inert substances and the light of the sun stimulates the growth of living things. This is a basic concept of Sankhya philosophy. Primordial energy has no motive power of its own, but the proximity of Spirit causes it to “live” and move. It is with us as it is with God. The presence of God causes the primal matter to manifest as all creation; and it is the presence of our spirit that causes our own private prakriti to manifest as a chain of ever-evolving births and deaths. Self-knowledge is the apex of our evolution, after which our prakriti becomes a mirror, silent and motionless, no longer moving, but reﬂecting only consciousness itself."

Some years back I read in an Eastern Christian magazine about an incident that took place in Yugoslavia. A Communist indoctrinator was mocking the ideas of God and the soul, saying that they could not be seen or touched and so did not exist. When he stopped speaking a man stood up and said: “I have a question for everyone who has been listening to you.” Then he turned to the assembly and asked: “Can you see this man’s mind?” “No,” they responded. “Then it does not exist, and to think so is superstition. So forget everything he just said–it was only a combination of physical forces without any meaning at all.” Somehow the “wisdom” of materialism evaporated before good sense.",

And the less it is seen and dealt with by the body and the senses, the more real it is. The absolute realities of God and the spirit are, then, completely beyond the reach of the senses or the mind. Although many attempts are made in religion to infer or deduce their existence, they are vain and in time lead to annihilation of themselves. Every “proof” set forth by limited reason to establish the existence of God and the spirit can be turned right back around and used to disprove them–that is the nature of any intellectual proposition. This is why the most effective atheist-materialists usually have a strong religious background. Both Stalin and Lenin studied for the Eastern Orthodox priesthood! Intuition alone can give us a shadowy hint of the presence of the Divine Spirit. And we must progress beyond intuition to direct experience of these fundamental realities. That is what Yoga is all about. Without a viable sadhana, these things cannot be known, and in time the intuition of their existence will be eroded and even lost–either in this life or in a future birth.",

It is true that we can see the effects of spirit, but there is no way reason can prove they really emanate from spirit and are not selfcaused. Only those who are clear at the center–the core of their being which is spirit–can see God, as Jesus said: “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.” (Matthew 5:8) The word translated “pure” is katharos, which means to be absolutely clear, free of all obstruction or extraneous matter or elements. Kardia, translated “heart,” means the core or center of something, and in Greek was a symbolic term for the spirit which is, of course, the absolute center of our being–is our being, actually.",

Sometimes we experience intense grief at their departure and absence, and at the same time really cannot feel that they are no longer with us. After all, we are in this earth plane because we are completely irrational–especially on the subconscious and emotional levels. When my miracle-working grandmother died, I grieved and shed tears over the loss every single day for one year, and yet only on the anniversary day of her departure did I fully come to realize that she was gone! In my heart I could not believe that I would not ﬁnd her in her house if I would just go there. So an intellectual understanding about birth and death does not help a great deal.

The solar system is said to pass through four ages (yugas) in which the general consciousness of humanity ranges from only one-fourth to four-fourths of its potential.

We are sitting in the “sense-surround” theater completely absorbed in the movies of our many lives and completely identifying with the spectacle. None of it is ultimately real, yet we suffer terribly. How is this? Unhappily, rather than “losing” our minds we have “found” them, become immersed in them, and now identify with them totally. All that happens to our body and mind we think is happening to us. And so we pass through a panorama of mistaken responses to the passing show.",

Then all suffering ceases–suffering that never really existed except as a mirage caused by non-existent phenomena. For Krishna assures us: “You dream you are the doer, you dream that action is done, you dream that action bears fruit. It is your ignorance, it is the world’s delusion that gives you these dreams.” (5:14)"

These are accurate and bona ﬁde expressions, of course, but “Arya Dharma” is the oldest expression and has a unique value. So important was arya in the vocabulary of the ancient Indian sages that India itself was known as Aryavarta, the Land of the Aryas, for the people living there were commonly known as Aryas. Buddha used the term a great deal. Although his teachings are referred to as “The Noble Eightfold Path” or “The Four Noble Truths,” what he really said was “The Aryan Eightfold Path” and “The Four Aryan Truths.” This is not without real signiﬁcance, so we cannot avoid looking at the word, no matter how distasteful its use in twentieth-century racial bigotry and genocide has made it for contemporary sensitivities. Hitler liked to toss around “holy” and “God” in his rants–as well as “justice” and “freedom”–but that in no way invalidates them. Evil as he was, he did not have the power to corrupt or degrade such an ancient term of honor–only to condition our response to it.

An aryan is one who puts forth real effort to improve himself in any area of life. Naturally arya was most ﬁttingly applied by the philosophers of India to spiritual and personal life. The word “noble” is too inactive, besides it can be interpreted passively, such as in thinking that a person is born noble or made noble by the declaration of another. An arya is one who labors to rise, exemplifying the saying that a diamond is a piece of coal that never gave up. Truly a saint is a sinner that never gave up, as Yogananda often said. In other words, an arya is one on the path to sainthood as well as one who has attained it.",

Dasyus are slaves–slaves of materiality living in willing servitude to lower life and consciousness. Aryas, on the other hand, strive upward into the light, into freedom."

Human beings do not need to be told that they are miserable, awful, sinners, but the truth: they are glorious beings who are tragically caught in the net of “sin”–but freedom is not only possible, it is inevitable, for it is their true nature.

We can think of it as dirt or dust that obscures a pane of glass or a mirror. It in no ways means something that God has forbidden or which he “hates.” Rather, it is a self-injury that inhibits and limits us. It is a bond that takes away our freedom. Consequently, we are free to choose which we want, otherwise we will be only servants and slaves. Only those who are free to be foolish have the freedom to be wise. This is the basis of the “live and let live” attitude of the East that so infuriates the missionary from the West."

Also, the second chapter of the Gita is entitled Sankhya Yoga. The Ramakrishna-Vedanta Wordbook says: ‘Sankhya postulates two ultimate realities, Purusha and Prakriti. Declaring that the cause of suffering is man’s identiﬁcation of Purusha with Prakriti and its products, Sankhya teaches that liberation and true knowledge are attained in the supreme consciousness, where such identiﬁcation ceases and Purusha is realized as existing independently in its transcendental nature.’”",

Buddhi Yoga, then is the Yoga of Intelligence which later came to be called Jnana Yoga, the Yoga of Knowledge. We have four levels of being, and the buddhi–also called the jnanamaya kosha–is one of the highest. So a buddhi yogi has his consciousness centered in the higher levels of his being. And he uses his buddhi to extend that yoga even higher into that level which is virtually indistinguishable from spirit. From then on Self-realization is assured. Yoga and Sankhya are inseparable, so buddhi yoga involves meditation as its paramount aspect. A Buddha is a successful buddha yogi. Unprejudiced reading of the Pali Sutras of Buddhism will reveal that Buddha was not only an Aryan, he was a classical Sankhya philosopher, a buddhi yogi. Anyone who wishes to follow Buddha must be the same. (Just as anyone who wishes to follow Christ must follow Sanatana Dharma as found in the Gita. Then he, too, will be a follower of Sankhya and a practicer of Yoga.)",

But in the scriptures of India it always is applied in a spiritual sense, meaning both union with God and the way by which that union is effected. Yoga, then is both spiritual life and the culmination of spiritual life. Yoga is union with the Supreme Being, or any practice that makes for such union.",

Yoga is the state in which the mind substance (chitta) has evolved to the point where no modiﬁcations (vrittis or waves) can arise. Buddhi yoga is the state in which desire can no longer arise, being eclipsed by awareness of the spirit-Self.

Shankara’s mission was to show that the ritualistic obsession of those who followed the karma-kanda–the ritual portion of the Veda–and who taught that Vedic ritual is the only path to perfection, were utterly wrong. By his masterly commentaries on the Brahma (Vedanta) Sutras, the Upanishads, the Gita, and the Yoga Sutras, he restored the original teachings of the ancient rishis and saved the very existence of Sanatana Dharma. Today adherents of that Dharma study the Vedas to discover the wisdom hidden therein, not to invoke them in superstitious manner. Credit must especially be given to the nineteenth reformer, Swami Dayananda Saraswati, for ﬁrst expounding the Vedas as purely spiritual texts that only appear to deal with externalities. Yet Krishna’s words are still relevant, for throughout the world (including India) religious people are following only the external appearances of holy scriptures, and are intent only in getting “the good things of life” while in this world and going to a “heaven” after death that is nothing more than a version of the earth without the ﬂaws. Gaining heaven and avoiding hell, getting reward and avoiding punishment–in other words, greed and fear–are their motives. The life of the spirit simply does not come into it.

Most religion is sociopathic, and a fundamental trait of a sociopath is denial of any responsibility. Everything and everyone is responsible for the sociopath’s problems–never himself.

Sometimes the rituals are very obvious pullings of the Divine Vending Machine’s handle, and sometimes they are masked with sentimentality passed off as devotion. One such, for example, is the extremely popular Satyanarayan Puja. This takes hours of ritual offerings, singing, and recitation of the glories of Vishnu (Narayana). But the “glories” recited are really accounts of all the amazing worldly advantages that have supposedly been gained through the ritual itself. In other words, God is not gloried at all–the ritual is gloriﬁed. It is just a Hindu religious version of the old patent remedy shows so popular in nineteenth and early twentieth century America. Sort of a holy infomercial for the puja. To sponsor or attend such an event is considered a mark of devotion, but of devotion to what? Or whom? Do they worship “the gods” or “the goods”?",
                              "Such purveyors of worldly goods through worldly gods also teach elaborate modes of behavior as well to gain the goods. These range from long and arduous pilgrimages culminating in more rituals and generous gifts to temples and priests, to avoiding things the gods “don’t like” and always having at hand what they “do like,” to the wearing of emblems honoring the chosen deity, to long recitations of the deity’s praises, to elaborate personal worship of the deity in a home shrine, to fasting or abstaining from work on days specially devoted to or favored by the deity. Millions of poor Indians fast and worship annually on a day whose observance is guaranteed by the “scriptures” to bring lifelong prosperity by a single observance. No one seems to notice they stay poor year after year. They even assure others that the observance is sure to gain wealth to all who engage in it. The same is true of another day whose observance guarantees the conception and birth of a son (sorry, girls). So barren and sonless couples devoutly observe it year after year with no result–not even a resulting skepticism regarding its efﬁcacy. The money just keeps rolling in–or out, depending on which side you ﬁnd yourself. And that is the whole idea, really. For notice that Krishna does not say the rituals convey power and pleasure; only that they are supposed to."

When I explained that Ma had given me speciﬁc instructions as to how I should spend my time, she simply parroted: “You must do some k-a-r-m-a y-o-ga.” It was noble of me to not point out that she was not doing a lick of work, but was just eating, sleeping, wandering around the ashram and bothering me. She had some mimeographed sheets of her “guru’s” instructions in strenuous breathing exercises, so after a while “You must do some k-a-r-m-a yo-g-a” got alternated with “You must do some p-r-a-n-a-y-a-m-a….” Some people are an endless source of annoyance.

Activity with desire is egocentric, whereas desireless action is spirit-oriented and results in freedom. No wonder Swami Sivananda-Hridayananda (Doctor Mother) told a bunch of Chicago “karma yogis” that Swami Sivananda was only karma yogi she had met in her life."

Some of them claim to need solitude so they can “write,” though little or nothing is ever published.

Further, he is neither elated nor disturbed when prapya–encountering, obtaining, attaining or incurring–that which is shubhashubham–pleasant or unpleasant or a mixture of both.

In other words, nothing moves him, for tasya prajna pratishthita–his consciousness, his awareness, and the wisdom that arises therefrom is established, standing ﬁrm at all times.

Although we usually think of “the senses” as the material organs of perception, in reality the senses are astral and causal, and their main purpose is to “see” in the spirit. So the liberated person truly lives “according to nature” on all levels. Seeing with the inner eye, hearing with the inner ear, etc., he sees and hears “true.” Also, it means that when he withdraws the senses he does not become inert and unconscious in what the yogis jokingly call “jada samadhi”–a state of mental inertia which is neither meditation or samadhi.

Such religions are nothing more than versions of Animal Trainer (God) and Animals (us). The Trainer is motivated by an irrational and insane drive to be adored and obeyed while employing means that can only make him hated and feared. The animals are living on instinct alone (called “faith”), dominated by fear and greed. When the animals do their tricks right they get rewarded; when they do not, they get the whip.

The Sanskrit has atmavyashyair vidheyatma: “having controlled himself by Self-restraint.” That is, he has controlled his lower self by moving his consciousness into the higher Self. Until he does so, the lower self drags the higher Self along from birth to birth. But when the Self comes into control of the lower self the situation is different indeed.",
                              "Atmic consciousness alone is the antidote to all our ills. When the sadhaka no longer acts according to intellectual or instinctual motives, but rather is living out in the objective world the inner life of his Self, then and only then is true peace gained by him. Acting out of intellectual belief, faith, devotion, or even spiritual aspiration, can certainly elevate us, but ultimate peace cannot be found until, centered in the Self, we live our life as a manifestation of Spirit. It was the Self speaking through Jesus that gave the invitation: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall ﬁnd rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” (Matthew 11:28-30) When the buddhi rests in the atman, peace is inevitable. That is what a Master really is: one who lives ever in his Self. Everything else needful follows as a matter of course. And how can this come about? Krishna tells us clearly in the next verse.",
                              "“In tranquility the cessation of all sorrows is born for him. Indeed, for the tranquil-minded the intellect [buddhi] at once becomes steady.” (2:65) Note that the cessation of sorrows is not bestowed on the buddhi yogi, nor does he acquire it. Rather, it is “born for him.” First is conception, then growth, then birth. It is a process that goes in stages. It does not come like a lightning strike, but slowly and in an orderly manner, for it is a natural consequence of the yogi’s essential nature. It is evolution, not revolution. This is why the idea of instant enlightenment, of instant liberation, springs from ignorance of The Way Things Are. For it is a revelation of That Which Has Always Been. This is the real “non-dual” doctrine of the Gita. The steadiness of the buddhi comes immediately upon the birth, but the birth takes time. That is what buddhi yoga is all about–coming to birth, truly being “born again,” really becoming a “twice-born.”"

How many times do we have to hear about how terrible “censorship” is, when civilized and lawful behavior is nothing but censorship? Nor is this censorship merely a private matter. Otherwise there could be no kind of society or culture at all. So the enemies of civilization and culture screech nonstop about the evils of “censorship” and “control”–especially in the area of religion. They express the philosophy of the guilty and the anarchic. In other words: the subhuman. They truly do wish to live as animals and not as humans. For discipline, control, and–yes–even censorship of behavior are signs of intelligence, of genuine humanity. It is also called conscience. A collection of humans form a society and develop a culture based on the same principles. Of course, wisdom must be the guide, but in a society of true human beings that is always present."

Even more, if further on down the path it seems natural to switch over to the other orientation, that, too, is all right, for in some lives we have to take up more than one unﬁnished strand and complete them. It is natural for us to move in many directions throughout our life. If there is only one God and therefore only one Goal, then whatever we do will move us forward along THE Path. “In whatever way men take refuge in Me, I reward them. Men everywhere follow My path.” (4:11) “I am the Goal.” (9:18)",

Therefore the gunas of prakriti, sattwa, rajas, and tamas, combine to force us to act. In this matter there is no free will–we cannot choose to act or not.

He does this for two reasons: 1) so we will not think that avoiding activity and “involvement” is the way to enlightenment, and 2) so we will not use our earthly responsibilities and ties as excuses for not exerting ourselves to the utmost in the pursuit of liberation. How many times have spiritual layabouts talked to me about how God had given them “all these responsibilities” and consequently they were dispensed from seeking God. It is just the opposite. God intends for us to seek and ﬁnd Him in the midst of those responsibilities–that is their purpose. They are not barriers or obstacles, but doors to pass through into higher life. One man actually told me that he could not look after his spiritual life because God had given him children whose spiritual lives he was to cultivate! Having nothing himself, he was going to supply them. He also overlooked the fact that God had done no such thing–he had traveled all the way to Asia and brought them back, another form of Great White Hunter who now had a menagerie to amuse himself with and use as pretexts for neglecting his own evolution.

But when the time comes that you really want the higher life, come see us.” Sri Ramakrishna said that by always being truthful a person ascends to higher life, even liberation. There must be honesty in all things, including religion. Of course, there does come a pivotal moment, a midway point, where the individual must say: “I really want what is bad for me, but even more I want to rid myself of such a foolish ‘want.’ Henceforth I will cut it off and cultivate the right kind of ‘want.’” That is not hypocrisy, because he openly admits his inner desire, but is liberating discipline.

There are devices which are activated just by someone approaching them–all the way from talking and moving ﬁgures to doors that open at our approach.

So may this all be Your doing.” This is a very important attitude. We entrust our actions to God when we offer them and rely on God to make everything come out all right. When I was little we used to sing in church: “When you have done your best, let Jesus do the rest, and keep your eyes upon the goal.” I did not understand what I was singing, but many years later after reading the Gita I did. Reliance on God is often the secret of detached action. Renouncing all action has pretty much been covered, but it is very much an attitude of indifference– not being numb in the mind or alienated from our surroundings, but being so intent on God that our actions are no longer ours but God’s. And if God is not interested–neither are we. So no problem. This gives profound peace of mind.",

In this small book Vyasa has said virtually everything we need to know regarding spiritual philosophy and spiritual practice. It would be pointless to attempt rating the level of importance of each verse, but surely one of the most informative is this: “One acts according to one’s prakriti. Even the wise man does so. Beings follow their own prakriti; what will restraint accomplish?” (3:33)",
                              "The word used here for nature is prakriti. Krishna tells us that all living beings act according to their prakriti. For example, under intense pressure a wheel made of rubber will bend, one made of wood or plastic will break, and one made of iron or steel will hold its shape and endure. The shape may be the same, but the substance makes the difference.",
                              "The prakriti of each one of us–especially the energy of our minds–determines how we act, think, and speak. It is possible to temporarily suppress the natural movements of our prakriti, but in time we will revert to our fundamental modes of behavior. Sri Ramakrishna illustrated this fact, saying: “At Kamarpukur mongooses live in holes up in the wall. When a mongoose stays up there, it is very comfortable. Some people tie a brick to its tail, so it is forced out of the hole by its pull. It is forced out of its hole by the pull of the brick as many times as it tries to go inside to stay in comfort there.”",
                              "The mongoose is the individual and the brick is the prakriti. The brick has been tied to the mongoose’s tail, and our prakriti has been attached to our atma-self. It is inescapable. We must deal with it–not by merely controlling or repressing it (though sometimes this must be done), but by transmuting it into a higher form.",
                              "Krishna’s statement is not fatalistic, but optimistic, for we can change the present state of our prakriti. We can–and must–change the prakriti-lead into prakriti-gold. This is possible only through yoga. Ethics and religious orientation can certainly assist the process, as can external puriﬁcation and right behavior, but they can only produce a favorable condition for the necessary transmutation."

The way a person thinks and speaks is a matter of prakriti, as is his view of himself, others, and life itself. This is why we cannot reason or cajole a person into thinking differently than he presently does. Conversion is actually impossible, though a person may discover ideas that vibrate in consonance with his prakriti and intellectually adopt them. This is particularly true in religion. Religion shapes no one’s mind–it is the other way around. Religion does not make people bigoted or hateful. Instead, bigoted and hateful people create or gravitate to bigoted and hateful religion. Cultish people join cults. Idiots join idiotic movements and ideologies. As the prophet said: “Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.” (Hosea 4:17) And Jesus: “Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.” (Matthew 15:14) There is nothing we can do; they must do it."

In this way you will come ﬁnally to the Lord, who is the light-giver, the highest of the high.” (8:8. Prabhavananda.)",

Those who are selfaware to any signiﬁcant degree know that such impulses come from inside us, not from outside. “The devil made me do it” is one of the most shameless evasions of responsibility of which the human being is capable. Too bad it happens to be ingrained in Western religion. No wonder we have a sociopathic society. All such impulses comes from us alone, and are our choices, our mental habits, on some deep subconscious level. The problem is, we have many “minds” and many “wills,” as we are presently only a conglomeration of fragments. The phenomenon of multiple personality demonstrates that.

Even simple wishes are pastel shades of kama. So simple “desire” is still the best translation. Krodha is anger in any degree, including wrath and fury. Hatred is essentially krodha.",

Whether the yoga was lost by carelessness or defects or omissions in teaching, or whether a time came when no one was even interested, the result was the same. The same is true of our private world. The mind is extremely gifted in forgetting or distorting the correct practice of yoga. Therefore we should be very vigilant and make sure that our practice is exactly correct, with not a single detail being neglected or left out. There are several contemporary spiritual organizations that over the course of years have so altered the yoga methods they teach that they have been rendered ineffectual–and in some cases, detrimental. How do we protect ourself from this spiritual erosion? Study the Gita. It is all there. If we read the Gita, the eleven authentic upanishads, and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali without prejudice or preconception we will ﬁnd they are unanimous in their teaching on meditation. It is only when they are “interpreted” by teachers claiming to have a secret or unique knowledge that the troubles begin. We must ignore them and look to the source."

                              "His eyes should be turned upward without strain, “expelling outside contacts and ﬁxing the gaze between the two eyebrows.” (5:27) Not that the yogi makes himself cross-eyed! This is not actual concentration on the point between the eyebrows, which would cause strain and tension, but a relaxed looking upward as though looking through the point between the eyebrows–the “third eye”–at a point far distant.",

This, according to Krishna, is the sacriﬁce known as pranayama.",
                              "Then, through the japa of Om, “having placed the vital breath [prana] in the head, established in yoga concentration, uttering the single-syllable Brahman, Om, meditating on Me,” (8:12-13) the yogi meditates upon the Supreme. For Krishna, the embodiment of that Supreme, tells us: “I am the Pranava [Om].” (7:8) “I am Om.” (9:17) And: “Among words I am the monosyllable Om.” (10:25) Further, in this last verse he continues: “Among sacriﬁces I am japa,” the repetition of a mantra, indicating how Om is to be employed by the yogi.",

Moreover, whatever state of being he remembers when he gives up his body at the end, he goes respectively to that state of being, transformed into that state of being. Therefore, at all times meditate on Me, with your mind and intellect ﬁxed on Me. In this way, you shall surely come to Me.” (8:5-7)",

He who thinks of Me constantly, whose mind does not ever go elsewhere, for him, the yogi who is constantly devoted, I am easy to reach. Approaching Me, those who souls are great, who have gone to the supreme perfection, do not incur rebirth…he who reaches Me is not reborn.” (8:10,13-16)"

                              "First we must understand the context of the Gita. The Gita is seven hundred verses within an epic poem known as The Mahabharata, that chronicles the Mahabharata (Great Indian) War that took place about three thousand years ago (according to the calculations of Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri). The original poem was written by the great sage Vyasa, perhaps the single most important ﬁgure in Indian spiritual history. The Bhagavad Gita is the supreme scripture of India, for it is the essence of all the basic texts that came before it. Further, it supplies a psychological side to spiritual practice that can be found in no other authoritative text. If someone desires, he can conﬁne his study to the Gita alone and yet know everything that is in those texts. Although it contains some references to elements distinctly Indian, it is the only universal scripture, its teachings being relevant to the entire human race.",
                              "Having said that, we must realize that although the Gita takes the form of a conversation between Krishna and Arjuna on the eve of the Great Indian War, it is not a historical document in the literal sense. Rather, Vyasa chose this critical juncture in Indian history as the setting for a complete exposition of spiritual life–itself a battle of sorts. It cannot reasonably be thought that Krishna and Arjuna sat in a chariot in the midst of a battleﬁeld discussing all the topics presented in the Gita–and in metrical stanzas of four lines containing eight syllables each (sometimes eleven syllables when Vyasa needed the extra length to get in all his ideas). Rather, the Gita is Vyasa’s presentation of the Eternal Dharma, though there is no reason to doubt that the wisdom of Krishna is embodied in it, or that much of it–at least in general–was spoken to Arjuna at Kurukshetra.",
                              "One of India’s greatest yogis in the twentieth century was Paramhansa Nityananda of Ganeshpuri. One day someone cited a portion of the Gita, prefacing it with the statement: “Krishna said in the Gita….” Immediately Nityananda said: “No. Vyasa said Krishna said….” This is the correct perspective on the entire Gita. What we are reading is the enlightened understanding of Vyasa, who in the Gita is presenting us with a digest of the yoga philosophy of the upanishads combined with both yoga psychology and instruction in yoga meditation. It is not amiss to say that Vyasa is the most important ﬁgure in Sanatana Dharma. If all other scriptures and commentaries disappeared and only the Gita remained, the Dharma would still be intact and suffer no loss whatsoever.",
                              "In general, then, Krishna is the voice of Vyasa, but within the Gita he is at times the voice of both the atman and the Paramatman. So when we ponder the meaning of his words we should consider how they might be understood in this dual manner. For example, when Krishna tells us to ﬁx our minds on him and worship him single-heartedly and steadfastly, he is not telling us to worship a God that is outside, but That Which is the inmost dweller of the heart. He also means that the focus of our attention must be on our individual being as well as on the Inﬁnite. For they are one in essence."

Because the “orientals” intuit their unity with God, while the “occidentals” feel utterly separated and alien from God. Consequently Western religion demands reconciliation and placation while Eastern religion simply calls us to unity, a unity that is essential and eternal. Westerners doubt their salvation, but Easterners know it is unnecessary. They may have forgotten their unity with the Divine, but they have never lost it. They do not ﬁnd salvation, they recover it. The inﬁnity of God and their ﬁnitude does not daunt them in the least. They rejoice in both as devotees and friends of God. Because only such people can know this, Krishna says its a secret–the Supreme Secret. Indeed."

This is not easy for us in the West who have lived from birth in an assumption that God perpetually reacts to us–that it is we who determine the state of God far more than He determines our state–and that we can control God’s “moods.” We have thought that our words, thoughts, and deeds will determine God’s relation to us and how He thinks of us and cares or does not care about us.

Paritranaya means “for giving refuge,” “for protecting,” “for preservation,” and “for the deliverance”– all that. And for whom? For the sadhus–those that seek the Real, the True: Brahman. Although in modern India the term sadhu is applied to monastics (sannyasis), or at least to full-time seekers of God even if they are not formal monastics, Krishna means this in the sense of anyone who pursues Brahmajnana. In other words, he means the yogis, those who seek union with Brahman. There is an implication here, then, that dharma is essentially–even exclusively–the seeking for God, the living of the yoga life.",
                              "But others are involved here: dushkritam, the doers of evil. His plan for them is vinashaya, “for the destruction,” of the evil-doers. When this is done, dharma is reestablished on a solid basis and the sadhus can pursue their aims in the right way in a harmonious and conducive environment. And this is done yuge yuge–from age to age. Whether Krishna is referring to the concept of ascending and descending ages as is current now, or whether he just means eras of human history cannot be known for sure. The important idea here is that whenever there is a need there is a manifestation of the Divine.",
                              "Because of the present-day obsession with gods and avatars, it is assumed in India that Krishna is speaking of yugavatars–avatars of the age–that appear rather like the ﬁgures in mechanical clocks, every hour on the hour. This, too, is indeterminable (though that does not keep people from trying). Of course every other contemporary “guru” is The Avatar of the Age, whose coming has caused the world to leap from the Dark Age of Kali Yuga into the Satya Yuga, the Age of Truth, the highest age. Strange that there is no evidence of that! In fact, things are getting worse on many fronts.…",

As one of the three reincarnated Jesus Christs I have met (the one that was a taxi driver in Blaine, Washington) told me when I refused to “recognize” him: I just do not have truth consciousness.)",

It is commonly assumed that God is born on earth at those times, but sambhavani means “I come into being,” or “I originate Myself.” Now there is no place in Sanatana Dharma for the idea that God comes into being at a point in time, or somehow creates Himself. Consequently, “I manifest” is the safest translation. Although there can be no argument against births of Divinity in a human form, manifestations can take place in many ways to awaken straying humanity. I know of situations where the people of entire countries had profound spiritual awakening while the rest of the world snored away. Such an event was the Welsh Revival at the beginning of the twentieth century. The end of the nineteenth century, the Ramakrishna Mission, inspired by Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda, was the impetus for a powerful movement whose effect is felt throughout the world even now. Nearer our time, the arising of the Thai Forest Tradition was a miraculous, spontaneous awakening that is still bearing fruit.",

Rather, through His power of Maya, He “dreams” creation and shows those dreams to us, enabling us to enter into His dream and dream along with him the dreams that will culminate in our awakening into His own Consciousness and Being, nevermore to forget ourselves in a dream body in a dream world. We, too, are ever unborn, though dreaming innumerable births and deaths.",

We suffer because the dreams get out of our control, but once we master our dreaming all confusion, doubt, weakness, and ignorance will cease and we will be “born again” into perfect spiritual awareness, into the ultimate liberation for which we were destined before we ﬁrst entered into relative existence–or appeared to enter, for it was all a series of educational dream-movies in the cosmic school of God Consciousness."

It is all a matter of the disposition of our inmost mind and heart. Many people think they are seeking God, and many more tell others that they are seeking, but God truly knows, and responds–or not–accordingly. What is so heartening here is that however God is approached, he responds. Since we are incapable of meeting Him on His own terms, He meets us on ours–and enables us to come up to His standards in time. For His motive is love. Those religionists whose motive is hate, greed, and ego, say otherwise, but that is their problem.

Even Shakespeare knew this, saying: “There's a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.” However much we tangle things up and subvert our true nature, however horriﬁc the mess of our life may be, yet we are walking in the One Path. The problem is, we walk the path in our manner according to our arrogant ignorance. Nevertheless, it is His path, and the moment we turn toward Him, however blindly or uncomprehendingly, we will start to walk it in His way–a glorious way, for it ends in Him. So we can say with Horatio, to whom Hamlet addressed the previous quote: “That is most certain.”",

This is logical, since He is the source of all. They may be misusing that path, but it cannot change the fact that every thought and act of a human being has its roots in the Divine Being. Humans may subvert and trivialize the power of God, but they cannot wrest it from Him. In time its true nature will be revealed. This is why we read so much of men and women who were spiritually awakened and redirected in the midst of their folly and wrongdoing. Some have stepped from darkness into light in the very act of evil–which they turned from in gladness. Many have found God present in the depths of degradation. That is why the Psalmist wrote: “Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I ﬂee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.” (Psalms 139:7-11) This we can know: whatever path anyone is now following, however foolish or negative it may seem, it is fundamentally God’s path.

As the boat glided along it came to the large bathing ghat of the town of Chandod. A hundred or more people were there, sitting looking over the river, visiting, or engaged in various tasks including bathing and laundry. As I watched this tranquil spectacle, for some reason the Christian missionaries in India popped into my mind. What a different reaction they would have! To my mind I was viewing blessed souls making their way toward the Divine Goal, souls whose ultimate destiny was assured. But the missionaries would see lost and darkened souls destined to be dragged off to eternal hell unless they (the missionaries) proclaimed the Gospel and persuaded them to “accept the Lord Jesus Christ”–someone they already believed in as a Son of God in a manner far more realistic than the erroneous theology of the missionaries. Because of this difference in viewpoints I was living in heaven; but they would be in hell–already.",

Yes, even the anxious and tortured missionaries will ﬁnd in time that their sincere endeavors have produced positive karma that will enable them to move from ignorance to wisdom. Then they, too, will know the truth expressed here in the Gita."

It is necessary for them to be “touched” by action, otherwise they would not evolve beyond relativity.

When we think about this we can understand why philosophies such as Sankhya reject the idea of “God” in the sense of a Cosmic Doer–Ishwara or Bhagavan.

See The Foundations of Yoga.) They can be neither mitigated nor abrogated. Many religionists attempt to do so, but their failure in spiritual life demonstrates their folly. In contrast, the yogi must carefully study the words of realized men and women–not the words of revelated “messengers of God,” but of true saints, true Masters, who proved in their lives that their consciousness was united with God. These great teachers tell us by their living examples and their words what is to done and what is to be avoided.",
                              "That is easy to say, but how can we know that a teacher really is genuine? Actually, it is not that hard to ﬁgure out: The holy ones of all true religions say the same thing. Those who deviate from the unanimous testimony of the saints are not to be fully trusted, even though they may be sincere and have good qualities. Only those who live in the same vision and inner state are completely trustworthy. That, too is easy to say. What are some traits we should look for in spiritual teachers? Here are a few.

Such a state of mind is not attained by reading a few pages of convincing philosophy, but we must pursue a path of mental cultivation that will enable us to be established in the Witness Consciousness that is our essential nature. Our problem is that we identify with the many layers of energy through which we experience relative existence. We not only mistakenly identify with the means of perception, we go a step further and identify with what is perceived. This is known as drowning in the ocean of samsara. The only antidote to this condition is the practice of yoga, as Krishna points out to Arjuna throughout the Gita.",

These two delusions dominate just about everybody. In India the action/inaction controversy continues, to absolutely no conclusion or practical value. The Gita gives a completely coherent answer, but still the confusion goes on. This is because it is not a matter of thinking about it, but of experiencing the truth of it. Krishna now brings this fact out."

My feasting was on the timeless wisdom I was ﬁnding in the pages of Paramhansa Yogananda’s fascinating Autobiography of a Yogi. As I drew near the ﬁnal pages, in the forty-ﬁfth chapter I read the account of Yogananda’s meetings with Anandamayi Ma, “the Bengali ‘Joy-Permeated Mother.’” At one point he asked her to tell him something about herself.

And yet, it is the presence of the Self that causes the dance-drama of the entire chain of evolutionary births which the Self witnesses without ever really taking part. This is impossible for the ordinary intellect, however keen, to penetrate, but the yogi, daily experiencing himself as the Eternal Witness–the same experience which is intrinsic to God–comes to see that behind all action is the inaction of Consciousness. Yet, it is the unmoving presence of Consciousness that stimulates Prakriti, the Divine Creative Energy to act. The Actionless causes all Action to take place. Only the yogi can really know this. “Even when he is engaged in action he remains poised in the tranquility of the Atman.”"

The ﬁrst meaning, that of desire, is uppermost in this part of the Gita, though people can pursue action with a blinding and binding passion, no doubt. However, it is best for us to think mostly of simple desire, since the palest shade of desire can mar our action. Also, desire can be incredibly subtle and undetectable to any but the keenest intelligence. Passion and lust, on the other hand, are extremely obvious and impossible to disguise–though many in their grip pretend that they are being dedicated, noble, and fervent in a righteous cause. Human beings can talk themselves into anything. But sensible people can see the ﬁend beneath the fever. Desire, though, is capable of disguising itself or hiding itself completely from all but the most perceptive.

It is absurd to say that a liberated person still has to “work out” his prarabdha karma–karma that has begun to manifest and bear fruit. This mythology is a rationalization put forth by whose who claim their guru is liberated while still very obviously bound by karma. A liberated person may decide to remain in this world, though having no karma to fulﬁll.

He who is disciplined in yoga sees the Self present in all beings, and all beings present in the Self. He sees the same [Self] at all times. He who sees Me Everywhere, and sees all things in Me; I am not lost to him, and he is not lost to Me.

To despise the lesser approach is as silly as to despise memorization of the alphabet because it is superseded by reading. The latter cannot occur without the former. The offering of the ﬁrst type of yogis is devotion of the heart–no small gift. The second type of yogi offers his Self by merging It into the greater life of Brahman.

That is, Brahman dreamed the dream of creation and of incarnating within it as its allexperiencing Self. Brahman is dreaming the same dream we are, but without loss of control or consciousness. This is an important fact for us to know. In Sanskrit terminology formulated later than the Gita, the witnessing consciousness of Brahman within creation is called the Mahat Tattwa, the Supreme Principle.

He also is telling us that discipline is a result of wisdom. So when we encounter a “sage” who freely imparts his “knowledge” we should look at how disciplined he is, and thereby know whether his knowledge is real or mere words."

Yoga Sutra 2:50 says that pranayama “becomes measured or regulated [paridrishto], prolonged [dirgha], and subtle or attenuated [sukshmah].” “Prolonged and light [subtle],” says Vyasa. Sometimes it is long and slow and sometimes it is slow but short. Whichever it may be, it is always spontaneous and not controlled–or even deliberately intended–in any way. Pranayama, then, is an effect, not a practice. This can be accomplished through objective observation of the breath, or even by simply sitting in right posture (asana) in a relaxed manner and being inwardly aware in meditation. There are also some easy and gentle methods for calming the breath, such as simple equal breathing or the method known as Nadi Shuddhi.

They, like their modern descendants, vociferously announce that “God” is a myth and that there is no one beside their “self” to know or perceive. But Krishna carefully tells Arjuna that the enlightened person ﬁnds all existence “in your Self AND also in Me.” That is a very important fact which the false “advaita” teachers deny almost hysterically.

In every way, jnana destroys sin (papa) to the uttermost degree. And Krishna assures us that jnana itself can do this–nothing else is needed. Further, he tells us that when we are perfect in yoga we ﬁnd this knowledge in our own hearts, for it is eternal, inseparable from the Self.

In the Yoga Sutras it is stated that samadhi, the entry into superconsciousness, is the result of Ishwarapranidhana–offering the life to God.

It is interesting how psychopathic people can become when confronted with their folly and evil. “Not I–but…!” they shriek, blaming anyone and anything for their error. Everybody is “in on the act” but them. In Genesis we see how Eve blamed the serpent and Adam blamed not only Eve but hinted that God was responsible (Genesis 3:9-13). “Why does God do this?…Why does God allow this?” is a common protest. Few are those who understand that they–and they alone–bear the responsibility for their actions and their reactions. But now in this ﬁfth chapter of the Gita the liberating truth is being given to us.",
                              "“The Lord does not create either the means of action or the actions of people, or the union with the fruit of action. Swabhava [self-nature], on the other hand, proceeds [in all this].” (5:14) Actually, Prabhavananda’s interpretive translation says it quite well, even if not literally: “Do not say: ‘God gave us this delusion.’ You dream you are the doer, you dream that action is done, you dream that action bears fruit. It is your ignorance, it is the world’s delusion that gives you these dreams.” Saint Paul spoke of the same situation, saying: “Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is ﬁnished, bringeth forth death.” (James 1:13-15)",
                              "The truly comforting part of Prabhavananda’s version is the word “dream.” All relative existence is a dream. We are co-dreamers with God. God dreams the cosmos, and we dream our involvement within it. No matter now horrendous and magniﬁcent the dream may be, at the moment of awakening it will be revealed as nothing but ideas–creative ideas, but still just ideas. Only the two realities–God and the spirit–will remain. Blessed cessation, blessed peace and freedom. So when confronting the truth about delusion we need not be horriﬁed or devastated by the fact that it comes from us. After all, even God dreams–why not us? God dreams rightly, but we dream wrongly. First we correct our dreaming, begin dreaming rightly along with God, and then we awaken. No more dream, no more delusion. Only Truth.",

Even so, the dream is of importance, because through this dreaming we develop and expand our consciousness. The dream is not worthless and is certainly not evil or wrong. It is our loss of control and the resulting confusion and bondage that is wrong. The correct perspective on this is necessary for our controlling the dream and enabling ourselves to awaken from it.",

When we draw back into our pure consciousness and begin to live in abstinence from the hallucinogenic of the world, we will begin to see through the veil into the Reality behind it. Eventually the veil melts away and we ﬁnd ourselves face-to-face with The Real. Until then we are the source of the trouble."

That is why I did not move away, seeing that it was only God who was coming as elephant.’ The teacher then said, ‘Yes, my child, it is true that the elephant God was coming, but the mahout God did warn you.

Some years ago we had a phonograph record of religious music whose cover was a hazy photograph of a monk holding a rosary and looking at it blankly (contemplatively?). One of our members pointed to it and said: “Before I came to the ashram I thought that was what monastic life was like.” Both members and visitors have expressed to me how surprised they were that in the ashram we actually worked instead of sitting around talking profound philosophy. But Sri Ramakrishna, speaking of this kind of misunderstanding, used to say: “If you can weigh salt, you can weigh sugar,” meaning that a person competent in spiritual life will be competent in material life–and often the other way round (but not always).",

Thoughts may be things, but things are not inner states. “Satisﬁed with knowledge and discrimination,…steadfast in yoga,” are absolute requisites.",

During these periods, if for some reason she comes into another part of the house everyone knows she is coming because a strong fragrance of roses precedes her, and if she speaks it is as though she is spraying rose essence into the air.

We will look at that ﬁrst and then consider other options. The ground should be ﬁrm, neither soft nor shifting as sand or gravel or on a heap of things that could slide.

A few years ago in California (where else?) I saw some “yogis” sitting on the edge of mountain with a straight-down drop of several hundred feet.

Kusha grass is considered purifying, and rings woven of it are sometimes worn in worship to keep the hands ritually pure. It is also a remarkable insulator, both physically and metaphysically. In India I have used kusha mats with a blanket on top for sleeping on damp ground in bitterly cold weather, and was never bothered with either damp or cold–at least underneath me. Such mats also make very good meditation seats, covered with a cloth. However, only dried kusha grass is used in matting, and the edges are very sharp and liable to cut the one handling it carelessly.",

A deer skin is the only animal skin considered appropriate for the yogi’s meditation seat (asana) because the vibration of the deerskin is neutral and therefore conducive to peace and tranquility. However, the deer must have died a natural death. To use the skin of a deer killed for its skin is to violate the precept of ahimsa. One of my vivid memories of the Hardwar bazaar is seeing deer skins for sale that had bullet holes in them. When I once expressed disapproval of this to a shop owner, he was quite sympathetic and said: “I understand how you feel about the deer being shot by a gun. Quite a few yogis object to that. If you give me some time I will ﬁnd you one that was killed with a bow and arrow. I will provide you with certiﬁcation to that effect.” When I explained that I was objecting to the killing of the deer, no matter what form it took, I could see that he thought I was being quite eccentric. Nevertheless, leading yogis have told me themselves that the deer must have died naturally. This makes such a skin hard to come by, since decay will begin right away. But it is possible, for I have seen them.",

He does not specify what kind, but at the time of the Gita cotton or silk would have been the common types. (Because the silkworms are killed to get the silk thread, many yogis would not use silk, though it, too, has insulating properties.) Paramhansa Yogananda recommended wool cloth as it also insulates against subtle earth currents as does kusha grass and silk. Sheepskin should not be used, as the sheep is killed to get it, whereas normal wool cloth is made from the wool sheared from the sheep without harming them.",

The head should be held so the chin is parallel to the ground. As Shankara directs: “The chin should be held a ﬁst’s breadth away from the chest.” This is done by making a ﬁst, holding it against your neck, and letting your chin rest on your curled-together thumb and foreﬁnger.

That is just self-torment. For the great yogic adepts also say that the posture must comfortable–easeful and relaxed.

                              "Having quieted himself. Many people become impatient with themselves or their practice if right away their mind does not calm down, but that is why yoga is a practice and not a matter of instantaneous effect. After all, each day we have spent hours and hours stirring up our mind and forcing it into reactions of all kinds. Moreover, it is a living entity, not a machine that can be switched off with the ﬂick of a ﬁnger. Right meditation practice will certainly still the mind after a while. But we must be helping it by arranging our life in such a way that distractions will be minimal. Diet is also crucial here. A rajasic or tamasic diet (to be discussed in the seventeenth chapter) hinders the efﬁciency of yoga meditation. And most of all, our thoughts and emotions condition the mind substance, making it either easier or more difﬁcult to still.",
                              "Banishing fear. This is not often discussed in writings or talks on yoga, but it should be given attention. It is no surprise that when we sit for meditation we will ﬁnd that our mind is restless and trivial. We also realize that long-buried impulses from the past–including past lives–may surface, such as anger, lust, greed, and so forth. But in so many lives, as well as this one, we have been in situations that produced a great range of fear in us, from simple apprehension to absolute terror. When such things surface we are not aware of the cause, only the fear itself, and this actually compounds the fear. The fear of death also can arise, because in meditation, as in sleep, there is an approximation of the withdrawal of the life force that occurs in death. I have known a few people who were bothered by the fear of death in the beginning of their meditation practice. How did they overcome it? By the practice of meditation itself–nothing special is needed. So when unreasoning fear rushes over us, we need only keep on as usual and it will be banished. At times we may feel anxiety at the onset of peculiar sensations in the body as well as the mind, and fear that we may be harmed by whatever is producing them. There is also fear in the form of doubt to be contended with: fear that our meditation may be of no effect, or fear that we will not attain as much as we should, and even fear that we will not live long enough to make any signiﬁcant progress. All these are just vagaries of the ego-mind and should be ignored.",

The idea that God “created” or ordained marriage so men and women could have all the sex they wanted in an approved setting is outrageous. All who aspire to true humanity–much less divinity–must be chaste in body and mind. Those who do not wish to so live should do as they please, but leave yoga alone. This is why Patanjali says that the ﬁrst step in yoga is moral observance (yama-niyama) which includes brahmacharya–celibacy.",

See how the yogi parents of Paramhansa Yogananda lived it as presented in Autobiography of a Yogi. In the very ﬁrst chapter we ﬁnd: “Mother made a remarkable admission to my eldest sister Roma: ‘Your father and myself live together as man and wife only once a year, for the purpose of having children.’” The fact that Yogananda, a devoted son and a pure-hearted yogi, would reveal this to the world in the pages of a book show how necessary he felt it was for both Eastern and Western readers to be shown the standard of chastity that yogis should observe in their life, not using their non-monastic status as excuse for lesser behavior. He underlined this later in the forty-fourth chapter, giving these words written to Mahatma Gandhi by his wife Kasturbai: “I thank you for the most perfect marriage in the world, based on brahmacharya and not on sex.” Please note that these are examples of married yogis, not monks imposing their ideas on others. Also remember that the guru of Yogananda’s parents was himself a married yogi, so there is no monastic inﬂuence in their case.",

Furthermore, it is a vow–a voluntary resolution. Those who do not wish to make such a resolution need not do so. But they should not lie to themselves and others by claiming to be yogis.",

Om is the bow, the arrow is the individual being, and Brahman is the target. With a tranquil heart, take aim. Lose thyself in him, even as the arrow is lost in the target.…Meditate on him as Om. Easily mayest thou cross the sea of darkness.” (Mundaka Upanishad 2.2.3, 4, 6) “O Lord, thou hast revealed thy sacred syllable OM, which is one with thee.

For him who is moderate in food and diversion, whose actions are disciplined, who is moderate in sleep and waking, yoga destroys all sorrow.” (6:16,17) Prabhavananda puts it very smoothly: “Yoga is not for the man who overeats, or for him who fasts excessively. It is not for him who sleeps too much, or for the keeper of exaggerated vigils. Let a man be moderate in his eating and his recreation, moderately active, moderate in sleep and in wakefulness.

The ignorant think that Brahman is known, but the wise know him to be beyond knowledge.” (Kena Upanishad 2:2, 3) Nevertheless, Krishna is able to give us a working idea of enlightenment, one which can be useful to the individual yogi so he will not mistake the goal or mistakenly assume he has attained it before he really has."

As Sri Ramana Maharshi continually pointed out, at the onset of enlightenment the buddhi is not destroyed, but rather is transmuted into the Self–for nothing ever really exists but the Self. As I say, this is important, for those who have no actual experience or realization make all kinds of statements, such as that since the enlightened have no mind they have no subconscious mind, and therefore cannot dream. And they love to challenge a yogi with the question: “Do you dream?” If the answer is Yes, they declare the yogi unenlightened. But when Ramana Maharshi was confronted with this silly question he simply said: “Yes. But not like your dreams.” When asked what his dreams were like, he answered that when asleep (yes, he did sleep) he saw the forms of deities and temples–two nemeses of contemporary “advaitins.”"

We need not even cut them off. Instead we should ﬁx our minds on God. For since all desires are merely aberrations of the primal desire that is in each one of us–the desire to ﬁnd God–the false desires will melt away.

This is because every element in our life must be looked at from a yogic perspective and ordered accordingly.

Rather, it is the ego-sense, the intermediary between the Self and the bodies in which it is encased.

It sustains the universe.” This verse is not easy to translate, because the word jivabhutam can mean either “consisting of spirit-beings” or “the world of Spirit.” One means many spirits and the other only one Spirit. In truth, both are correct, as the universe exists solely through the presence within it of the many eternal, individualized consciousnesses.

True, it has cut itself off from that source and has taken on a kind of independent life of its own–but that is its own illusion catching up with itself. The bedrock truth of all things is that behind and separate from them is the Primal Purusha, the Supreme Consciousness that is inseparable from all beings and the very Principle of the existence of all things, and our own jivatman, our own individual Self.",

We must always have in mind the fact that the Reality behind the deluding appearance is the Inﬁnite Self from which we draw our very existence.

We must shake ourselves awake from the dream of separation. Part of knowing ourselves consists in experiential awareness of our origin: Prakriti united with Purusha. This is why the concepts of Heaven-Father and Heaven-Mother are central to any intuition-based spiritual view. One without the other is nonsense. Even in the upanishads which so emphasize the transcendent aspect of reality that can be symbolized as Father, the necessity of the Mother is found. (See the third chapter of the Kena Upanishad.)",

No. When Krishna speaks disapprovingly of desire he means an ego-centered force that clouds the intelligence and impels the will to unreason. In other words, he is speaking of desire that is not an act of intelligent will but a product of egoic passion–and therefore of delusion.

In the beginning this was known, and human beings sought for realization and nothing less. But as ages passed, this insight faded away to be replaced by earthly desires. Not being able to get all they wanted materially, humans–who still retained a goodly portion of their original psychic perception–began to resort to external powers to assist them in the desired gain. At ﬁrst they no doubt simply used their psychic understanding to manipulate the subtle levels of existence to manifest what they wanted, but when their psychic powers declined they had to resort to other intelligent beings that were not human, such as those who control the forces of nature. These beings became “gods” to them. Also, humans formulated thought-forms–constructs of psychic energies that could respond to their wishes and provide them with what they wanted to gain or accomplish.",

The higher gods drew power from ritual worship, praisings, devotional acts, and such like. Images of the gods were made as focal points by which the gods were contacted and even energized. The images themselves took on a kind of semi-life–semi-consciousness, even.",
                        "In India, at the time of Krishna at least, the low spirits we may rightly call demons were not worshipped–only higher nature-guardians and thought-created entities that were of a benevolent and “clean” nature. It is those “deities” that Krishna is talking about when he then says: “Whoever desires to honor with faith whatever worshiped form, on him I bestow immovable faith. He, who, endowed with this faith, desires to propitiate that form, receives from it his desires because those desires are truly ordained by Me.” (7:21, 22) The Sanskrit is a bit tricky to untangle, but Prabhavananda no doubt has put it best: “But it does not matter what deity a devotee chooses to worship. If he has faith, I make his faith unwavering. Endowed with the faith I give him, he worships that deity, and gets from it everything he prays for. In reality, I alone am the giver.”",

Unlike the false gods created by egoistic mankind, God wills only our welfare–even physically–and will foster our reaching out to something beyond ourselves even if that reaching is done ignorantly and short-sightedly. He is willing to do this, for in this chapter he has already told us: “I am that desire in beings which is according to [consistent with] dharma.” (7:11) It is these things alone that he will give to those who worship mistakenly. The evil things gained from other worship comes from the corrupt will of man, whether alone or linked with a demonic intelligence or force."

Yoga Maya is, of course, the power of Maya, of divine illusion.

Since God is the Eternal Subject, He knows (perceives) all the waves that appear and disappear upon the Ocean of Being which He is. By His nature He knows all things, but “things” by their nature cannot know Him. It is a matter of Who in contrast to the “what.” We, being part of God, have the same capacity to know “things,” but in us the experience of thingness has swallowed up awareness of our true nature. This condition is not native to us, so in time it will melt away and we will once more know truly. Of course we have to work at that–and that is what yoga is all about. We can once again be established in our Self, and from that center we can come to know God Who is at that center. That is why Jesus said: “Blessed are those who are clear (catharos) at the center (kardia), for they shall see God.” (Matthew 5:8)"

                              "The new idea presented in this verse is the concept that by entering into all beings as their Indweller God has become The Primal Sacriﬁce. Interestingly, the best elucidation of this idea is to be found in an esoteric Christian ritual–the Mass rite formulated by Bishop James I. Wedgwood, founder of the Liberal Catholic Church. In one of the prayers God is addressed as Him “Who, abiding unchangeable within Thyself, didst nevertheless in the mystery of Thy boundless love and Thine eternal Sacriﬁce breathe forth Thine own divine life into Thy universe…. Omnipotent, all-pervading, by that self-same Sacriﬁce Thou dost continually uphold all creation, resting not by night or day, working evermore through that…enduring Sacriﬁce by which the world is nourished and sustained.”",
                              "God does not only sacriﬁce Himself by entering into limited modes of being, he also does so by willingly experiencing all the attendant changes and states of mind inherent in those conditions. Many people ask how God can allow people to suffer, not realizing that He is suffering every pain and sorrow that all beings–not just humans–are enduring. A dying person only experiences the suffering and death of a single body, while God is experiencing the suffering and death of an almost inﬁnite number of bodies–all at the same time. There is no nuance of struggle or suffering that God does not undergo right with us. Is this not a sacriﬁce beyond all conception? The sufferings we undergo are for our eventual beneﬁt; they are necessary for us. Yet God , who certainly needs no such, agrees to live and experience all that we experience. There could be no greater sacriﬁce, no greater mercy, no greater love. So the next time we feel like complaining about our “fate” let us remember that God is enduring the same fate right along with us."

The same would be true of positive experience during birth or death, which is why in India sacred mantras are recited during both times–at least by the spiritually intelligent. In this way the individual both comes into incarnation and leaves it accompanied by the remembrance of God.

If we have been spiritually mediocre (the ignorant call it being “balanced” or “following the middle way”) we will go to a middling world.

Turn it down.” He also said that you can teach a parrot to constantly say “Radha-Krishna!,” but if you pull its tail feathers it will only squawk.

Being alive, the cosmos requires that all things manifest this duality in a cyclic manner, that the positive and the negative polarities alternate in dominance. This can be seen in everything that “lives.” In fact, the more alive something is, the more evident are the alternating cycles. This principle manifests most obviously in the human body. The universe, being the “body” of God, also possesses this duality. Just as the “image” of God, the human being, breathes in and out to live, in the same way God “breathes.” The creation/manifestation of the universe is the “exhalation” of God, and its withdrawal/dissolution is the “inhalation.” Therefore Krishna says: “They who know that the day of Brahma extends as far as a thousand yugas, and that the night of Brahma ends only in a thousand yugas; they are men who know day and night.” (8:17)",

This vast ﬁgure given by the rishis is based on a relationship between the length of the solar year and a multiple of Pi (3.1416, the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle). The life span for a whole universe, according to the ancient seers, is 314,159,000,000,000 solar years, or ‘One Age of Brahma.’”",

That is why Saint Paul urged: “Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief.” (Hebrews 3:12) This is not a matter of simple non-belief, as I have said. There is no wrong in not believing something, even if it comes from a limited understanding. It is the refusal to believe that is being spoken of here.",
                              "The same thing is found in the life of Jesus. We are told: “He did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.” Even: “He marvelled because of their unbelief.” (Matthew 13:58) It is evident that to Jesus unbelief was an actual psychic/spiritual force, not just a matter of ideas. The Greek work translated “unbelief” is apistia, which means to deliberately refuse to believe something from perversity of will, not sincerity of opinion. Such a crookedness of intention bars anyone from approaching the most secret knowledge."

Many who have for decades “followed in the ways of righteousness” sink into a degradation undreamed of by them or those who know them. I myself have seen this sad phenomenon several times. In each case it was because, however sincere they may have been, they busied themselves with the externals of religion and did not gain inner, spiritual experience and knowledge. Thus, their inner disposition had never really changed. But the knowledge Krishna offers us is a transformative force, going far beyond “forgiveness of sins” and “getting right with God.” It is a transmutation from the baseness of material, egoic consciousness into the gold of spirit-consciousness. And I do not mean consciousness of spirit as an object, but the Consciousness that IS Spirit.

Surely such a sublime philosopher would be beyond my understanding. Nobody likes to risk being proved a dummy, but I took the chance and opened the ﬁrst book to hand. Staggering revelation: it was beautifully comprehensible! More: it was gloriously simple– and equally profound. Happy amazement.

This is because we all are righteous in our inmost being, and those who resolve to conform their outer life to their inner nature are at that very moment righteous. Oh, yes, they will still have negative karmas and their minds and hearts will need to be cleared out and puriﬁed, but if they make that genuine resolve–not a whim of the moment or a reaction of fear of future misfortune–they will rise above the karmas and conditionings and manifest their atmic nature.

The idea is that the person suffering from moha is bereft of reason and utterly overwhelmed by a passionate response to the object. Usually it is thought of as being directed to a person, but it can also be delusive obsession with a material object and even an aspiration or ambition for something or someone. Asammoha is complete absence of such obsession. So asammoha means levelheadedness and clearsightedness.",

Those who are constantly steadfast, who worship Me with love, I give the yoga of intelligence [buddhi yoga] by which they come to Me.” (10:9,10) This is an accurate description of a real jnani, a true knower of Brahman. Contrast this with the contemporary “advaita teachers” that clutter the landscape at this time. Also notice that verse nine implies that when we completely orient our lives toward God we will attract to ourselves other devotees with whom we will speak of divine things, each encouraging and assisting one another in the path to God-realization."

But you are not able to see Me with your own eyes.

This is because dharma is the very nature of Brahman and ultimately is the same as Brahman. This is unique to Sanatana Dharma. Whereas other religions say that dharma is a matter of obeying God or doing what God wants, Sanatana Dharma knows that it itself is Brahman manifesting in this world. It is not a matter of the will or whim of a deity, but Reality in demonstration. This is how yoga can be the science of the Divine. Praying, praising, serving, believing, and all such– none of this has any reality. This should be no surprise, for all along we have known that Brahman alone is real."

Rather, it strengthens and moves forward the machinery of the universe, purifying, elevating, and stimulating it. And it does the same to those who are the Godwards. But demons in human form revolt and ﬂee when confronted with divine worship. I have witnessed this many times. They also protest when anything of a spiritual nature is brought even peripherally into their environment. They howl in many ways: some quite sophisticated and intellectual, and some in overt hatred and spite. But the wellsprings are the same: inner evil. On the other hand, the Godwards joyfully worship and praise, thankful to be able to do so. This is a special trait of Eastern worship, Hindu, Taoist, Buddhist, and (Eastern) Christian.

Inﬁnite Lord of Gods, You are the dwelling place of the universe, the imperishable, the existent, the non-existent, and that which is beyond both.” (11:37) Here, too, there is one point that is relatively new to our study: “You are… the existent, the non-existent, and that which is beyond both.” It is not hard to ﬁgure that God encompasses all that exists, but how can Brahman also be what is not? “What is not” has three aspects: 1) what is not because it exists only in a potential form–as does the entire ﬁeld of relative existence when it is withdrawn after a creation cycle; 2) that which has never so far existed, but which Brahman in Its limitless creative power could bring into existence; and ﬁnally 3) everything that “is” simply because nothing relative ever really exists at any time, but is only a idea in the individual and the divine minds. Since “is” and “is not” is a dwandwa, a “pair” of dualities, it is obvious that for Brahman, being beyond duality, such distinctions cannot exist. That which transcends “is” and “is not” is Brahman Itself. In this context, “is” is no more real than “is not.”",

In India, to touch someone even unintentionally with the foot is considered great carelessness and rudeness. When that happens, the offender touches the feet of the person and beg their pardon. To touch them deliberately, and kick them (even gently) is a cardinal insult. Yet, very dear and close friends sometimes do such things in jest as sign of intimacy and comraderie. We are also told that if Krishna remarked that it was going to rain, and then it did not, Arjuna would say: “What a prophet you are! How wise! How all-knowing!” and mock him. He would also address him familiarly, leaving aside Krishna’s royal and spiritual status (everyone knew Krishna was Yogeshwara, the Lord of Yoga).",

You are the father of the world, of all things animate and inanimate. You are to be revered by this world. You are the most venerable Guru. There is nothing like You in the three worlds. How then could there be another greater, O Being of incomparable glory? Therefore, bowing down, prostrating my body, I ask forgiveness of You, O Lord.

How could we have done that? Like Arjuna we may try to ﬁnd consolation in the idea that God is friend, father, and lover, but in the long run that will not avail. Real peace will only come to us when we realize that God is our ultimate Self, that we are absolutely one with Him–so how can he be either pleased or displeased with us?

God knows what He is doing. The eucharist of the Liberal Catholic Church speaks of “the limitations of time and space, wherewith it is Thy will to veil our earthly eyes from the excess of Thy glory,” because at its present level of development the human mind cannot cope with its fullness. Arjuna experiences this, too, and therefore says: “Having seen that which has never been seen before, I am delighted, and yet my mind trembles with fear. Show me that form, O God, in which You originally appeared. Have mercy, Lord of God, abode of the universe. I desire to see You wearing a crown, armed with a mace, discus in hand, as before. Become that four-armed form [as Vishnu], O thousand-armed One, O You who have all forms.” (11:45,46) Sometimes we have to settle for the veil rather than what is being veiled–at least for a while longer.

The yogi knows that both are true, but the philosophers insist on holding to one and rejecting the other, or declaring one to be higher or more accurate than the other.

But why is their grasp better? Because they are able to focus their intention on a concept of the Divine that is not only within the scope of their intellect, it is a concept that inspires their seeking, for it is based on love which, as Swami Sriyukteswar points out in The Holy Science, is in its essential nature a magnetic force that unites the seeker with the object of the seeking.

I admit that it puzzled me because I was so conditioned by the “You behave yourself!” rebukes from parents to unruly children.

The entire discourse takes place on the battleﬁeld of Kurukshetra in North India. Naturally the Gita is considered symbolic as well as literal and historical. The ﬁrst symbol to be considered is “ﬁeld.” The thirteenth chapter of the Gita is all about that. It opens with questions by Arjuna: “Prakriti and purusha, the ﬁeld and the knower of the ﬁeld, knowledge and the knower of knowledge: I wish to know about these.” (This verse is not found in all texts of the Gita.) As pointed out before in this commentary, the Gita is really an exposition of Sankhya philosophy, the original philosophy of the upanishadic sages. The prime concept of Sankhya is that of the divine duality of purusha and prakriti– matter and spirit, energy and consciousness. This concerns every person looking to understand his present situation and his potential attainment. It is not without signiﬁcance that in his question Arjuna puts Prakriti before Purusha. Being a yogi, he knows that we must deal with the material-energy side of things before we can hope to know about spiritual matters. Also, he implies the threefold mystery: knower, knowing, and known. Separating them into their true boundaries is essential for us."

Awareness of the not-Self (anatma) must also be there, as Buddha pointed out. That is, we must learn what is not “us” and what is. So when we encounter the bewildering vagaries of “the ﬁeld” we can be at peace and say: “That is not ‘me.’” Identiﬁcation with the body is one of our greatest errors that must be seen as the phantom it really is. This is why yoga has so much to say about the ﬁeld. We must recognize and master it so the knower-Self can fully manifest within and through it.",

Sages have sung of it in many ways, distinctly, in various sacred hymns and with aphorisms concerning Brahman, full of positive reasoning.” (13:3,4) This great knowledge is completely traditional, and Krishna is reminding Arjuna of this fact. There no “new yoga for a new age.” Rather there is “eternal yoga for the eternal spirit.” That is what the Gita is all about.",

Basically everything we “know” in a objective manner is the ﬁeld. If we can perceive, recall, and name anything–it is part of the ﬁeld and should be known as such and never identiﬁed with. All Krishna has listed is anatma–not-Self."

                              "Therefore, although we must never forget our essential nature as spirit, everything in our experience–in the ﬁeld–is an objectiﬁcation of mula-prakriti, the root-energy from which all things are formed. For this reason yoga is very much a matter of prakriti, for it is prakriti that needs to be reﬁned and evolved to become a perfect reﬂection of the purusha. That alone is liberation. So yogis pay great attention to such things as diet and health. Meditation practice itself entails certain necessary elements, which is why Patanjali lists asana, pranayama, pratyahara, and dharana as prerequisites for meditation. (See the chapters “Om Yoga–Ashtanga Yoga” and “The Foundations of Yoga” in Om Yoga: Its Theory and Practice.)",
                              "To cultivate a false, abstract “spiritual-mindedness” that denies or ignores prakriti is to be in error. For: “Prakriti is said to be the cause in the producing of cause and effect [action and reaction]. The purusha is said to be the cause in the experiencing of pleasure and pain.” (13:20) This verse is extremely difﬁcult to translate. The idea is that prakriti is the source of both action and the instrument of action, but purusha is the source of the internal experiences and internal reactions–“our experience of pleasure and pain”–that result from the movements of prakriti. Consciousness is an attribute of the purusha. The more conscious we are–the more we identify with consciousness itself rather than objects of consciousness–the more “real” we are."

We experience the different modes (gunas) of materiality, and our reaction to them–whether positive or negative–intensely attaches our awareness to prakriti. The character of our attachment/aversion determines the kind of birth we will have. Most translators employ the expression “good and evil wombs,” and Prabhavananda has “pure or impure,” but the Sanskrit says sadasadyonijanmasu–birth in real (sat) and unreal (asat) wombs, or birth in true/real or false wombs.

We are only born in families of people with whom we have a deep afﬁnity. True, that afﬁnity may be more subconscious than conscious, but it is there and is a force to be reckoned with. We have no doubt all known people who denounced their parents or family for traits which they themselves possessed. I knew a scrupulously honest young man who was born into a family of low-level criminals. It would have been wisdom for him to realize that criminality was latent in him and watch his mind carefully to guard against it. Again, we all know people who “rebelled” and “cut the cord” and “got away” only to return after some years and become exactly like their parents. Look at the militant hippies of the sixties. Most of them became more bourgeois than their parents. Jane Fonda became a Cub Scout den mother! “Sadhu, beware” is always wise counsel."

Further, it tells us that ignorance, indifference, or numbness in relation to the world is not spiritual but degraded. We see this in the saints.

For a very positive reason–so we will detect demonic ways in ourselves and counteract them, and so we will discern whether those we encounter are divine or demonic. For the wise yogi avoids the demonic and seeks out the divine. If he ﬁnds demonic persons already in his life he eliminates the associations. Usually when he meditates and changes his vibration they fade out of his life, but if not then he must himself terminate the association as gently and diplomatically as possible.",

The demonic not only don’t know what they should or should not do, they hate the very idea of knowing, because then they would have to face their corruption. And they hate anything that would somehow make the truth plain to them. They are opponents of truth, purity, and right action. And that includes those who contentedly (often smugly) say: “I am an agnostic.” As Jesus told Nicodemus: “This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.” (John 3:19-21)",

It is amusing to think how annoyed many yogis get when Fundamentalist Christians ask if they are “saved,” but here we have the same concept in the Gita! Those away from God are “lost” and those that have been rescued from that state are “saved.” The souls wandering in illusion from life to life are certainly lost–lost to God and to themselves. When we begin practicing meditation we see how lost we are to ourselves. Fortunately, this is only a mental condition that can be corrected by our own effort, and not the truth of the matter.

Yogananda once brought a cat to Brahmacharini Radhalila and asked her to care for it, saying that it had been a human being.

The demons, on the other hand, are completely assured of their worth and goodness. So, since Krishna’s message will only be heard by those of divine tendency, he tells us how to ensure that we will not fall into demonic consciousness: “This is the threefold gate of hell, destructive of the self: desire, anger, and greed. therefore one should abandon these three.” (16:21)",

Rather than desires we should have intelligent decisions backed up by the enlightened will.",
                              "Krodha is anger in all its shades of intensity. Anger is really frustrated and demanding egotism. As Krishna explains: “For a man dwelling on the objects of the sense, an attachment to them is born; from attachment, desire is born; from [frustrated or disappointed] desire, anger is born. From anger arises delusion; from delusion, loss of the memory; from loss of the memory, destruction of intelligence [buddhi]; from destruction of intelligence one is lost [destroyed].” (2:62, 63)",
                              "Lobha is greed, which includes envy and covetousness. Of the three it is the most obviously egotistical. It is both ego-worship and a demand that others worship our ego, too. Any force of “I want” is greed.",

This being so, Krishna assures us that: “Released from these three gates to darkness, a man does what is best for himself. Then he goes to the highest goal.” (16:22) This is one of the most important teachings of the Gita. Tamodvarais can mean either “gates to darkness” or “gates to tamas.” In this instance I think it does mean the ﬁrst, but it is instructive to realize that desire, anger, and greed, although rajasic, if indulged in will lead us down into tamas.",

Otherwise we follow our ego-whims, claiming to be intuitive and following our inner wisdom. Only those in the blinding grip of ego think that they can ignore the counsels of the enlightened and manage. But of course in most instances they really do not plan to manage. Rather, they plan to fall and then feel justiﬁed in abandoning any semblance of spiritual life altogether. “I used to be a yogi;” “I used to be a vegetarian;” I used to be celibate;” “I used to be religious;” and worst of all: “I used to be a monk (or nun).” As Yogananda often said: “People are so skilled in their ignorance.”",

Shraddha always means faith, but in the sense of an intuition-based conviction, not just a mere unquestioning belief. So Arjuna is presenting us with the picture of a person who believes wholeheartedly in the efﬁcacy of spiritual action or practice, but who disregards the principles of spiritual tradition as set forth in the scriptures or teachings of the enlightened ones. Such a one simply goes ahead and does what he thinks is the best way to approach spiritual life, picking and choosing what he does and how he does it. This is not what Krishna has been saying to do! So Arjuna wants to know if faith, or belief that the actions will produce the desired effect, will compensate for the disregard of the shastras (scriptures). In other words, he is thinking of the type of person that in this century claims to be “spiritual, not religious.” Can that really “work” Arjuna want to know?

They can make life miserable or even terminate it–all according to the karma incurred by their petitioners. And this is how it is with the “positive” ones! Some yakshas and rakshas are degraded, demonic beings, avid for worship, gifts, and power, lying and deceitful, always scheming to injure and deceive those who approach them, though for a while they seem benevolent in order to ensnare their devotees. Their only intention is to delude and plunder. Filled with pride they despise those that approach them and from the initial contact intend to lie and loot them. These, too, will harm and destroy those that offend them. Both these types, higher and lower, are the “gods” worshipped by greedy, egoic religionists of all types–some quite openly deal with such beings while others do so in a secret or deceitful form. And of course these entities continually introduce themselves as gods, saints, and great masters."

Some degraded Spiritists do the same, but the followers of Alan Kardec, being sattwic, communicate with higher spirits, and often with holy spirits of the level of the saints and angels. (The Spiritism of many is an augmentation of their Christian–usually Catholic–spiritual practice.) Beside the pretas are the bhutas that range from earthbound ghosts to “elementals” and subhuman nature spirits. Some of these are deluded, evil, or just plain stupid. Some of them, being completely outside the stream of human evolution, do not really know what is going on, but play with humans the way tame animals would. Nothing good can come of any of this.",

Some even kill human beings, not realizing that they are doing so. Air elementals often urge people to jump out into the air, thinking they will ﬂy with them. Water elementals urge swimmers to keep swimming further and further from shore until they become exhausted and drown–though that is not the elementals’ intention. Fire elementals urge people–and especially children–to play with ﬁre in hopes of a conﬂagration, though destruction is not their purpose. Earth elementals urge people to continually go underground and often try to keep them there by cave-ins and other mishaps. Again, they have no concept of death, so the elementals have no malicious intent. They just want to be friends.",

Mostly he is wanting to show us how we can determine the guna of a person–or a religion–by scrutinizing their supernatural contact. What about those that have no supernatural contact of any kind?

Lack of salt produces mental and physical debility, which is why sensible employers supply salt tablets to workers who perspire a great deal while at their job. One hellish summer I was in Benares and feeling terrible, hardly able to think. I had gone to visit the publishers of the Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series, whose main ofﬁce was in a sweltering attic. As I sat there feeling like I could die and afraid I was going to pass out, I came to the conclusion that I should leave my fellow travelers in India and return to America and check into a hospital for tests. I really felt that bad. Mercifully there popped into my mind the matter of salt tablets. Upon leaving there, I went directly to a drug store and bought some. That night before sleeping I took several–and awoke in the morning feeling completely well and mentally alert. Nothing can justify the prohibition of salt except in special medical cases such as high blood pressure, and then it should be made by a qualiﬁed medical practitioner.

Chillies contain a natural form of quinine that is very cleansing for the digestive tract and helps in warding off malaria, another tropical danger. To tell yogis to never eat chillies in any form is irresponsible as well as ignorant.",

There are negative “yoga fools” that do the same. They call their food prohibitions “eating sattwic,” but Krishna will say in just a few verses that tamasic people like tasteless food–and they recommend it too. The idea that the yogi’s life is to be bland and boring did not come from real yogis. And that applies to food, as well. Krishna will also point out that sattwic people like ﬂavorful food. As one famous yogi told me: “Boring people like boring food and interesting people like interesting food.” Everywhere in the world there are dim, petty people who make it their lifework to stymie and discourage others.

                              "I have mentioned these few things to give you a general principle of judgment in matters yogic. Some years ago I found a wonderful book, The Seventh World of Chan Buddhism by Ming Zhen Shakya. It is wise and sometimes very funny. One chapter has a section on how the six different “worlds” of samsara are reﬂected in human beings, and especially in their approach to meditation. One kind are the “Titans” or Daityas, powerful and endurant demons who constantly war against the gods in both Hindu and Buddhist cosmologies. Here is how he describes “daitya yogis”:",
                              "“Titan Chan. In mythology, Titans were the crudely powerful ancestors of ancient Greece’s more genteel gods. And following in that tradition, people who practice Titan Chan have a brutish, sadomasochistic approach to religion. They are strict disciplinarians who can go no other way but ‘by the book.’ Whether inspired by martyrs, crusaders or drill-sergeants, they are convinced that their commitment to Buddhism and to the welfare of the monastery exceeds everyone else’s. And they truly believe that the indices of that commitment are pain, sweat, discomfort, deprivation, and compliance with a code that would make the KGB blush.",
                              "“Even though Titans are noticeably hard workers and reap considerable–if grudging–praise for their efforts, they still ﬁnd it necessary to glean a last measure of satisfaction by denigrating the work of others. Though they grouse and nit-pick in differing verses, the chorus is always the same: ‘If you want something done right you have to do it yourself.’ As Titans understand religion, evil can be purged and goodness acquired by a variety of colorful ordeals. In addition to their daily rituals of sacriﬁcing themselves in the performance of chores, they will, with all due fanfare, undertake prolonged fasts the difﬁculty of which is greatly lessened, they will modestly note, by considering the slop manufactured by the present kitchen crew; or they will take vows of silence, a tactic which allows them to glower, scribble, hiss or otherwise graphically mime their criticisms.",
                              "“During the leg-stretching, walking period that mercifully divides a long meditation session, Titans will remain seated in perfect posture demonstrating that they never abuse others more than they abuse themselves. In Japanese meditation halls one monk is assigned the duty of keeping everyone alert. He prowls the aisles with a long stick and if he catches someone nodding, he whacks him on the shoulder. These blows are rather bracing and should anyone decide for himself that he requires this stimulant to keep awake, he bows to this fellow and is ﬂogged accordingly. Needless to say, Titans bow repeatedly. Witnessing their battery does not conduce to tranquillity though it is considerably more relaxing than having one of them on the other end of the stick.",
                              "“Traditionally, in Chinese Buddhism, after completing seminary training, both men and women novitiates go through an ordination ceremony during which three or twelve cones of burning incense are placed on the crown of their shaved heads. When these cones burn down they sear the scalp leaving permanent scars. At some later time the newly ordained priest might decide to repeat this cone-burning ordeal as a special penance or offering of some kind. Titans, of course, are among this practice’s most enthusiastic followers. Much like college football players who get little stars glued on their helmets to advertise their meritorious acts, Titan monks can have their scalps decorated with little round burn scars. (In Guangdong province, I met an old monk who had a few dozen more than the obligatory three or twelve. He laughed about them, attributing the excess to youthful exuberance. ‘Much like tattoos,’ he said with some regret.)",
                              "“To strangers, i.e., anyone who has not yet proven lazy, incompetent, spineless or immoral, Titans can be surprisingly congenial. But their initial friendliness is only a beachhead from which they will later stage attacks of righteousness. Intimidating martyrdom is not a strategy for winning close personal friends; but it does succeed in gaining attention and status.”",

One evening a group of customers called for the chef and rhapsodized over the delicious “stufﬁng” that had been in the grouse.

It is necessary for us who have not traveled the path to consider the advice of those who have successfully traversed it. We need not be slavish or idolatrous about any scripture or teaching, but we need to seriously consider the words of those who have been inspired from within to lead humanity toward higher life. Mary Baker Eddy very aptly called such persons Way-Showers. This implies a very practical attitude toward them: they are not gods or absolute authorities, but they show the way to succeed in spiritual life.

Belief, obedience, or “surrender” have absolutely nothing to do with it. At all times it is according to the judgment of the seeker. Sometimes we have to follow a path to ﬁnd out for ourself if it works. And nothing is sadder than those who spend years getting nowhere, yet clinging to a worthless discipline because they have “committed” themselves to it or–even worse–have entered into some pathological personal compact that enslaves them and blinds them to the evidently valueless character of that path or association. Most unfortunate of all are those who are bound and blinded by “love” for the teacher or group that is stagnating and devastating their lives and hearts. “Loyalty” is the slave-collar about their neck.",

Such a way of life is not engaged in for any other motive than being in harmony with the cosmic order the ancient sages of India called Ritam. Truly spiritual people live a spiritual life because it is according to their true nature. They are expressing their inmost being. They are not trying to become something, but are moving out of darkness into the light so they can know what they really are–to behold their eternal Self, that which Buddhists call the Original Nature. Real spiritual life is not loading ourselves with an array of spiritual paraphernalia, but divesting ourselves of all that is not us."

So Krishna is speaking of the wisdom of enlightened teachers that have been put into words and set down for our help in pursuing spiritual life.",

In the West we tend wisely to shy away from “tradition” because of the deadly ignorance of those who boast of being “traditional.” But in the East tradition is always subject to intelligent scrutiny and is never a matter of “the book says it, so I believe it.” Most important, authentic spiritual tradition is understood to be veriﬁable by each seeker for himself. In the West many are satisﬁed with intellectual jugglery and argumentation, but in the East it is practical experience that is sought. Whenever I quote a scripture in my writings I certainly think of it as lending authority to what I have to say, but I usually use quotations simply because the scriptures say it much better than I can.",

Either way, its characteristic is the darkness, confusion, and delusion of tamas.",

So, while adulating the scriptures they really cast them aside. Consider the way every religion manages to condone spiritually poisonous behavior and thought, wresting the scriptures to not only approve, but often to advocate them. No religion is free from this, as anyone with open-eyed experience and observation will know. Often the divine light of holy wisdom is completely covered by the evil and untruth of a religion’s popular form.",
                              "Finally, vidhihinam can also simply mean “without knowledge (vidya)” or “discarding (ignoring) knowledge.” In other words, ignorant and ineffectual religion that boasts of its “faith” since it has no substance or reality. Today we ﬁnd many religious currents in the world that were born in ignorance, and went on from there to greater ignorance. There are also religions that started out with authentic spiritual knowledge, with true spiritual revelation, but turned away from it in order to gain power and wealth. This is especially the case with state religions, or those that used to be state religions. Having remodeled their spiritual structure to suit their governing patrons, they lost their original value, and often the patronage, as well. Christianity is the latest and most blatant example of this.",

Its absence would indicate religion that is vague, even purposeless, performed in a rote way simply for the doing of it, or religion whose real purpose is not at all grasped, and is therefore meaningless. But mantrahinam is like vidhihinam; it has the dual meaning of “without mantra” or “disregarding mantra.” This indicates religion that is without order or legitimacy, and especially religion that is without power, for power (effectiveness) is the fundamental characteristic of mantra. So we are looking at a religion that never had any spiritual power, or has come to discard–and even deny–that power. It can also be applied to the adherents of a religion that does have power and knowledge, but regarding which they are either ignorant or indifferent.",

This means a religion in which the members engage in take-but-no-give policy–the obverse side of the type where the religion only demands and takes. Such religion is proud of the fact that it expects nothing of its adherents, and they are proud of that, too. “Our religion is democratic ,” they boast. “You don’t need to do anything you don’t want to.” They confuse democracy with anarchy. It is certainly true that in worthy religion the members are not coerced or cajoled in any way. But people that want to avoid all involvement, commitment, or investment of time and thought are unworthy of such a religion and will never beneﬁt from it until they change their outlook.",

As Mirabai, the great poet/musician saint of India wrote: “I have sold everything in the marketplace of this world and bought my Khanaia (Krishna). Some laugh at me and say the price was too great, and some say that the price was too small. But Mira only knows that it was everything she had.”",
                              "Devoid of faith. The last quality of tamasic religion listed is shraddhavirahitam–devoid of faith or having abandoned faith. To really understand this, we must remember that shraddha is not mere intellectual belief, but an interior, intuitive conviction that arises as an enlivening of the inner intelligence of an individual. In other words, a religion of shraddha is a religion that is spiritually alive, and therefore inwardly perceptive. In the sixth chapter of the Gita we have this description of one who has this divine shraddha: “The yogi…has become one with Brahman,…easily encountering Brahman, …I am not lost to him, and he is not lost to Me.” (6:27,28,30) This is the religion we should seek, realizing that it can be hinted at outwardly, but can only be achieved inwardly. As Jesus said (Luke 17:21): “The kingdom of God is within you”–actually is you.",
                              "Tamasic religion really has no genuine perception at all–it is only obscurity and confusion. However, there are degrees of tamas (as with the other gunas, as well), and we can encounter people who have no faith in their religion because they dimly intuit that it is nonsense. But, being tamasic–one quality of which is inertia–they stay with it and go through the motions knowing it means nothing. Here, too, we ﬁnd religions that once had a mystical aspect but jettisoned it for material gain or from spiritual blindness resulting from impurity and dulness of heart. There are individuals that are the same. For whatever reason, they blind themselves to the insights they once had and become wanderers in the fog along with so many others. I have seen people do this for various reasons, but the result was always the same: inner death. And I have never seen one regain what they willfully cast aside. Rebirth alone will restore it to them, and after how long a struggle?",
                              "The whole subject of tamasic religion is certainly gloomy, but spiritual adults know they have to acknowledge a lot of facts that are not pretty or pleasant, just as in material life unpleasant realities much be faced. The up side of the whole thing is that having given careful consideration to the matter we can avoid slipping into its ways and ourselves losing our inner vision.",

Puja is the word usually translated “worship,” and some translators use it rather than reverence. Worship in Krishna’s view is not mere verbal praise or gloriﬁcation, but a living out of the interior attitude of reverence. As Jesus once asked: “Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?” (Luke 6:46) So to reverence a spiritual authority is not to ﬂatter, grovel, and promote them or shower them with money and gifts.

                              "Now here is an interesting question: Since the list ascends in spiritual excellence, why were devas/ gods at the bottom of the list? Because there is no substitute for contact with living, breathing human beings that are examples of the ideals we should pursue. More importantly, it is easy to fantasize and believe we are in contact with high spiritual beings when it is all a projection of our minds. Even worse, we can be duped by the entities known as “tramp souls” or “astral trash” that are always ready to show up and claim to be everyone from our grandfather, to Abraham Lincoln, to Krishna, Buddha, or Jesus. It is important to have as teacher an honest human being that will be truthful to us regarding whether or not we are practicing correctly and progressing as a consequence. The ego may not like it, but the spirit will be liberated.

Literally, it means “good-doing,” so it implies that the rajasic tapaswin wants to be thought well of in general, which of course will result in the four meanings just listed. Mana, which means honor and respect. Puja, which usually is translated as “worship,” but can also mean reverence akin to worship. In India they basically go together. Guru puja is quite common, and almost as common is the claim of disciples that their guru is really an avatar, a divine incarnation. This is carried to absurd lengths all the time. Contrary to Buddha’s assertions, many contemporary Indian teachers are ﬁngers pointing to themselves–not to the goal of nirvana.",

                              "Swami Sri Yukteswar, the guru of Paramhansa Yogananda, continually cautioned people to never believe the claims made about yogis, especially the claims made by their disciples. Rather, he counseled them to carefully examine matters for themselves. As a young man he heard of a yogi who always slept in a state of levitation. So he hid under the yogi’s bed and waited. Nothing but snores. So he crawled from under the bed and said in a loud voice: “I don’t see any levitation–only sleep!” The yogi woke up, and to cover himself shouted: “I wondered why I did not levitate tonight as usual. You were spying on me!” The young Priya Nath merely laughed and went his way, not impressed by the declaration.",

I personally know one Big Baba of Bengal who claims he spent over twenty years in the Himalayas, when investigation easily shows that he was a building contractor in Calcutta all the time! Swami Sivananda humorously wrote some instruction for these people. First, he said, rent a little house (kutir) in Rishikesh or Hardwar for six months. Arrange to have your food brought to you, and never be seen by anybody. Sit around inside and do what you like, including a lot of sleep. During that time write two or three “trash leaﬂets” (his expression) and a couple of bad devotional songs (bhajans). Then at the end of the six months go down to the plains and put it out that you have been living in silence (mauna) for many years way up in the Himalayas, even beyond Uttar Kashi. Arrange for yourself a few meetings where you will talk aimlessly, sing your bad songs, and give out your worthless leaﬂets. In no time at all you will be a sought-after guru, and maybe even an avatar.",

Rajasic is a nice word for it.",
                              "Krishna winds up the subject by saying that rajasic tapasya, besides its obvious ﬂaws, is worthless because it is chalam–unsteady and wavering–and adhruvam–impermanent, inﬁrm, and unﬁxed. This is because rajas by its nature is restless and changing. A rajasic person does not hold single-mindedly to anything for long. Therefore any tapasya will be impermanent, especially because it is not oriented toward the unchanging and ever-existent Absolute, but rather toward the ever-changing and unsteady ego-dream."

In Sanatana Dharma alone is there a clear understanding of the Atman-Self. And if you don’t even know who or what you are, how can you even live life in a sensible manner? Most people do not.

Ritual mutilation is often practiced on their own bodies by those engaged in negative ascesis. Or just the opposite: they will harm the body through deluded indulgence and lack of discipline or puriﬁcation. But most of all they will torment their Self by burying It beneath ignorant ideas and actions, clouding and distorting their minds so there is no hope of comprehending true spiritual matters or disciplines.

I am sorry to say that this is found in India even to this day. I know of a “sadhu” who lives in a temple in Kerala and who does incredibly complex and strenuous disciplines to get such power.

This is often the aim of such tapasya: either the unseating of a person in authority or advantage, or the bringing about of his loss of money, position, or reputation. Sometimes tapasya is engaged in just to be thought “more ascetic than thou” in relation to others engaged in spiritual discipline. A kind of ascetic one-upmanship and rivalry is often found among monastics of all religions. This was especially the case in Christian monasticism in the Egyptian desert during the third century (and after) when enough time had lapsed for the Church to have greatly forgotten what Jesus had really taught about spiritual life and discipline. Regarding this, in his book, Benedictine Monachism, Dom Cuthbert Butler wrote:",
                              "“The spirit, the dominating principle of this monachism, may be thus characterized. It was a spirit of individualism. Each worked for his personal advance in virtue; each strove to do his utmost in all kinds of ascetical exercises and austerities, in prolonging his fasts, his prayers, his silence. The favorite name to describe any of the prominent monks was ‘great athlete.’ And they were athletes, and ﬁlled with the spirit of the modern athlete. They loved to ‘make a record’ in austerities, and to contend with one another in mortiﬁcations; and they would freely boast of their spiritual achievements. One who had seen them describes the Nitrian monks as ‘surpassing one another in virtues, and being ﬁlled with a spirit of rivalry in asceticism, showing forth all virtue, and striving to outdo one another in manner of life.’ But it is in Palladius’ account of Macarius of Alexandria that this spirit shows itself most conspicuously: ‘If he ever heard of any one having performed a work of asceticism, he was all on ﬁre to do the same;” and Palladius illustrates it by examples. Did Macarius hear that another monk ate nothing but one pound of bread a day? For three years he ate each day only what broken bread he could extract in a single handful through the narrow neck of a jar. Did he hear that the monks of Pachomius’ monastery ate nothing cooked by ﬁre throughout Lent? He did the same for seven years. Did he hear that their observance was ““great””? He did not rest satisﬁed till he had gone to see, and had beaten them all.’ Thus the practice of asceticism constituted a predominant feature of this type of Egyptian monachism. Their prolonged fasts and vigils, their combats with sleep, their exposures to heat and cold, their endurance of thirst and bodily fatigue, their loneliness and silence, are features that constantly recur in the authentic records of the lives of these hermits, and they looked on such austerities as among the essential features of the monastic state.” Much more crazy things were (and are) done, but this is sufﬁcient for us to get the idea–and hopefully avoid it."

You said to us, ““Datta—Be charitable.”” ‘Yes,’ agreed Prajapati, ‘you have understood.’” (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 5:2:2) So Dana, which means: giving, gift, charity, almsgiving, self-sacriﬁce, donation, and generosity, is both an action and an attitude. Krishna considers this an important factor in spiritual life, one which we will proﬁt from understanding. Once more he analyzes a subject from the aspect of its guna-quality."

As is to be expected, ignorant people who think that outer action equals inner quality, are enthusiastically embracing and applauding this fraud. Yogis, too, from both their good will and the sincerity–often simplicity–of their hearts may unsuspectingly run in this track as well. For discrimination (viveka) is often mistaken for cynicism, and is sure to be denounced by the deceivers and the deceived. Delusion is always favored by the deluded.

It is not an option, but a necessity–at least for those seeking to climb up the evolutionary ladder through cooperation with universal law. This has many aspects, not the least being that charity is a powerful antidote to negative karmas accrued through past greed, selﬁshness and hard-hearted refusal to help others. It also heals the mind scarred by callous and cruel indifference to the needs of others.",
                              "Given to a worthy person. Patre means someone who is worthy or competent, a person who is deserving and capable of beneﬁting from the gift or assistance. Sattwic charity itself must be worthy and competent. That is, it must be intelligent and effective, helping people not just for the moment, but for the future. Sattwic charity is not just “need driven” on the surface, but must take into account the entire situation and be very focused on the quality of the recipients and the ultimate results. For example, it is silly to provide roller skates for poor children when they do not have any shoes. Just recently I heard a brag ad on radio about many teenagers working hard to provide cosmetic surgery for poor people. While people are starving and wandering the streets homeless, this is absurd–not innately, but from the present conditions. This is like dropping candy bars to people in the desert that are dying of thirst. Get them out and give them water. This is the sattwic way. Of course, sattwic charity requires personal contact and care, something that so many are not willing to provide.",

He transformed the lives of countless thousands through the spiritual counseling he gave in the confessional. Once he had been invited to an out-of-the-way place, and even though deep snow had fallen he insisted on traveling on foot to keep his promise to the people there. On the way he fell and broke his leg. Finding a stick to help him move, and holding to the shoulder of a fellow-traveller, he actually went on and kept his appointment. Upon arrival he immediately went to the church and into the confessional, despite the protests from those around him. Many hours later, after having uninterruptedly heard confessions, he agreed to be examined by a doctor…who found that the leg was perfectly healed!"

God told the prophet Samuel: “The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” (I Samuel 17:21) Therefore Krishna points out in this and the next verse that the inner attitude of the giver reveals the predominant quality (guna) of the act. To give grudgingly or unwillingly is a rajasic attitude. A great deal of religion is not done willingly, but out of fear, greed, or other egoic motives. Since rajas is the guna of action for gain of some kind, he then says that any gift that is made with the purpose of getting some personal beneﬁt, looking for the ﬁnal result, is of rajas.",
                              "As a consequence it would not be amiss to wonder if the giving described in the previous verse as sattwic is not really rajasic? For “doing the right” also produces a beneﬁt which is surely desired by the sattwic individual. The answer is both yes and no. Certainly the sattwic person wants to attain and maintain the “to be done” attitude which tends toward his personal liberation, but the focus of such a desire is the transcendent Self, whereas the focus and motivator of the rajasic desire is the transient ego. So they are of vastly differing quality. Further, the sattwic person is thinking of the persons to be helped, but the rajasic is thinking of himself. The sattwic man is unselﬁsh, the rajasic man is selﬁsh. They are poles apart.",

I have heard people make utterly contemptuous remarks about the people they were going to go out and “make nice” to, even getting tearful with fake “caring” for those they denigrated. On the other hand, many tamasic people are overtly disdainful of those they are helping. This is particularly true of religious charities, especially the Protestant ones. I do not say this out of prejudice, but from a lifetime of observation. Those involved in Catholic charities are consistently kind and truly interested in those they help. Protestants, being the proud originators of “the work ethic” are usually just foremen, herding “the rabble” and obviously just “cleaning up the mess.” Again, I have seen this myself, especially in “rescue mission” endeavors. Just as jailers consider all inmates guilty and deserving of little but a hard time, so these people consider their charges nothing but lazy nuisances who really deserve being booted out onto the street and allowed to suffer or else rounded up as vagrants and put in jail."

What their next life will be, who can say? But it will not be a step up."

Other actions are permitted the seeker, as are other kinds of desire. For example, mumukshutwa, which is intense desire or yearning for liberation (moksha), is permitted, for it arises from the Self, not the ego. Action which maintains the body–such as eating or taking medicine–with the desire for continued life and good health, is also acceptable, if life and health are desired so sadhana can be continued. So also is any action based on a desire to help others. It is important to understand this, because many unripe aspirants get the mistaken idea that any desire whatsoever is detrimental, and that monks cannot engage in any action–something that is impossible for the living.",
                              "Sannyasa, then, is external, even though based on internal disposition. Tyaga, however, is completely mental, a state of both thought and attitude. It is perfect dispassion toward the results of any action–not from disinterest or indifference, but because all actions engaged in are “to be done” in and of themselves. Even if no result comes, it does not matter. It is the simple doing that matters. (Of course, even then, there is a result from having acting in consonance with the cosmic order–Ritam).",

People hardly read books, and when they do they are unbooks–books of trivia facts. The ﬁrst of these was the bestseller The Book of Lists. It is considered a virtue if a book need not be read completely, but just picked up and grazed in at random. As Dietrich von Hildebrand the great Catholic philosopher pointed out in his writings, modern people suffer from what he called “discontinuity,” the inability to sustain anything that requires more than minimal thought or will. So of course the previously-cited traits apply to them. It is a though everyone has ADD. For this reason society is run by those whose greed and lust for power–and often simple dedication to evil–motivate them and enable them to sustain their intentions and endeavors. The loonies and racketeers really have taken over the asylum because the staff is sleepwalking through life."

The word niyatam, here translated as “ordained,” literally means controlled or subdued, the idea being that sattwic action is that which is done as discipline, as a symptom of mastery of the lower levels of being. Although sattwic action is done without attachment, sangarahitam also means “without clinging [sanga]” as well as without attachment. A sattwic person can let go of his actions, let what is done be done and the past truly be the past and move onward. This is no small capability."

I also have some videotapes made of “disciples” that are some hours in length. And it is the same story.

For only through yoga can there be any appreciable or permanent control of the mind, prana, or senses. The key word is avybhicharinya, which does mean “unswerving,” but also means “not going astray” in the sense of not departing from the right practice of yoga.

It often takes the form of pessimism and distrust of others. Vishadam also can mean a kind of lassitude, and “what’s the use?” lack of motivation.

Notice that, unlike sattwic and rajasic happiness, tamasic happiness does not transform into anything other than what it is at the beginning. It does not lead to anything, but remains utterly inert. Sattwic and rajasic happiness leads to conclusions about their merit or demerit. Tamasic happiness, on the other hand, simply lies there and wallows in its own inertia. It goes nowhere.",
                              "There is a lesson for us here. We need not worry about sattwic people because they will become increasingly established in sattwa. We need only wait for rajasic people to “wise up and move up” to sattwa. And we need not even give a second thought to the tamasic: they are going to stay right where we see them. The essence of this is that sensible people do not go around trying to change others. The sattwic are already what they should be, the rajasic are moving toward sattwa, and the tamasic are simply that: tamasic. They “come from the nowhere and go to the no-place.” The wise bless others and keep on working on themselves. Certainly they will encourage those with them on the path and even assist them, but they cannot put anyone on the path or keep them there. Experience proves this over and over."

I have lived with great yogis who greatly loved music and beauty, but they never formed an attachment or addiction to them.

                        "Sri Ramakrishna is unique among India’s spiritual teachers for many reasons, but one of the most remarkable is his ability to make clear in a sentence what others would take a multitude of words to make only slightly more comprehensible. Whenever he prefaced something with the words: “Do you know what it is like?…” A gem of astounding wisdom would follow–and so simple that anyone could understand easily. He formulated a whole system of spiritual life that is unequaled for its simplicity and profundity. He deﬁned bhakti and jnana in a sentence apiece. Here they are:",

                        "Obviously a sensible person ascribes to both propositions. Only the accomplished yogi is really a jnani or a bhakta. Consequently Krishna says: “Absorbed in [one with] Brahman, he whose self is serene does not mourn, nor does he desire [long for or hanker after]; impartial among all beings [the same to all], he attains supreme [the highest] devotion to Me.” (18:54) Well, there we have it! Bhakti and Brahmajnana are inseparable. Actually bhakti is the fruit of realization.",
                        "Yet bhakti is both cause and effect, for he continues: “By devotion to Me he comes to know Who I am in truth; then having known Me in truth, He enters Me immediately.” (18:55) Literally, part of this verse says: “He comes to realize how great and Who I am.” It also equally means: “He comes to realize the extent of my Being”–the inﬁnity of God. Having known this in truth–not just in theory or “on faith”–such a one straightway enters Brahman.",
                        "“Performing all actions, he whose reliance is always on Me, attains, by My grace, the eternal, imperishable abode.” (18:56) Madvyapashrayah literally means “trusting in Me” or “taking refuge in Me.” This is a natural result of those who have understood that their seemingly separate existence independent of God is an illusion, that God is in very truth their All in All. Thus He becomes their “eternal, imperishable abode,” and they themselves are revealed as eternal and imperishable."

For even when sitting still, the body is acting at a tremendous degree, and that is all under the direction of the subconscious mind. So we are thinking and acting all the time–otherwise we would die. For this reason Krishna makes a point of saying that all actions must be renounced chetasa–mentally. But he is not advocating just pulling back the mind and being indifferent and feeling separated from the action, just being an observer. For that would be mere mental isolation. Instead, he says: “Mentally renouncing all actions IN ME.” That is something completely different. He is telling us that by the constant remembrance of God and awareness that we are living in God, that all is God, we should do all actions in the awareness that it is ultimately the divine power that is acting, that we are witnesses, but not passive witnesses. Rather, we are intent on following the counsel: “Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.” (Job 37:14)",
                              "Though Sargeant has “yoga of discrimination,” the Sanskrit is buddhiyogam, the yoga of the intellect in the sense of the yoga of our highest and subtlest levels and spiritual faculties. Yoga that does not reach to these rareﬁed levels is not any yoga at all, but a muddling around in the lower levels of our being that will conﬁne our awareness to those levels. That is why the Gita advocates yoga based on sound (shabda), on the Pranava, Om.",
                              "Certainly discrimination will result from our tapping into those supreme levels of our existence, but buddhi yoga is so much more. Krishna says: “Constantly think of me.” Which is why Patanjali says that the japa and meditation of Om is The Way."

We actually think we can circumvent God and do as we please. Basically, we plan to make a fool of God, not realizing that we are only making a fool of ourself. Our very existence depends on God, and if we are wise we take refuge in God–not in the manner of a pygmy grovelling at the feet of the “master,” but by entering into God and reclaiming our eternal and irrevocable unity with God.

People are trying any way they can to avoid their only possible destiny. See how they scramble after mirages, disdaining the glorious realities open to them, making pathetic excuses for their pathetic lives. Yogananda said that during his early years in Boston he was once walking in a neighborhood when suddenly God showed him that the houses were just like chicken coops and the people inside were like chickens that pecked, scratched, laid and hatched eggs, and ended up fried chicken! God then asked him if he would like to become fried chicken; and he replied: “No, Lord. I came with Thee and I will go with Thee.” A wise resolve.",

For what is a man proﬁted, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” (Matthew 16:25,26) So they pass from life to life in confusion and suffering.

It is not a matter of whether or not we will become seekers of God–only when. But as I say, by delaying we make the struggle much more ferocious and fraught with fear.",

This is why the Gita merits our highest valuation and our conformity to its glorious message. Krishna respects the free will of Arjuna and knows that ultimately it is all Arjuna’s decision. To interfere with that will by promises, threats, warnings, and cajolings will only produce a temporary conformity to Krishna’s words. Only when it arises from within Arjuna’s illumined understanding can he rightly engage in battle. Nor can we “live the life” if it is not based on our own impulse to divine realization and our full awareness of all that it implies. Krishna tells Arjuna to give full consideration to what he has been told and then act–not out of faith in Krishna, respect for Krishna, or love for Krishna, but because he knows it is the truth, having understood for himself.

How many times have we heard people say: “Don’t tell me that!” about something they know is true? And we all grew up with: “What you don’t know won’t hurt you,” the idea being that what we don’t know will not obligate us. Wrong! For in the depths of our being we DO know the truth, even if our whole life is a denial of it. That is why God says in the Bible: “Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.” (Psalms 82:6,7.
