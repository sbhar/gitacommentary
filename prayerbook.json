                  "One of the most significant attributes of Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism is its easily accessible practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.This profound yet simple method of Buddhist practice is the perfect Buddhist teaching for the modern world.",
                  "Practice is one of the three pillars of Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism, the others being faith and study, through which we can bring forth our innate Buddhahood. Practice entails two aspects, practice for oneself and practice for others. Chanting Nammyoho-renge-kyo is the primary practice for oneself. Nichiren Daishonin specified recitation of certain portions of the Lotus Sutra as a vital supporting practice for oneself. Doing both the primary and supporting practices each morning and evening gives rise to maximum joy and benefit in our lives.",
                  "Nichiren Daishonin never gave specific instructions on the format for the sutra recitation.But he did recommend reciting the “Expedient Means”(second) and “Life Span of the Thus Come One” (sixteenth) chapters of the Lotus Sutra,which are the heart of all Buddhist teachings.",
                  "He taught that our existence is identical to the universe as a whole and the universe as a whole is identical to our existence.Each individual human life is a microcosm of the life of the universe.We recite the sutra and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the universal Law,so that our lives perfectly harmonize with the universe. Carrying out these practices activates the infinite power that the microcosm inherently possesses. It transforms our fate, helping us to break through apparent deadlocks and convert sufferings into happiness. It creates a transformation of our inner realm, leaving us invigorated, refreshed and positive.Through our primary and supporting practices we develop wisdom and compassion to lead both ourselves and others to happiness.",
                  "Our twice-daily prayers establish a rhythm in our lives, moving us toward happiness and harmony. By making this consistent effort, we will attain perfect unity with the universal Law and experience the state of Buddhahood.Buddhism aims to make people free in the most profound sense; its purpose is not to restrict or constrain. Doing these daily prayers is a privilege, not an obligation. Tenacious efforts are required, but these are all for our own sake.To have great benefits or develop a profound state of life, we should exert ourselves accordingly.",
                  "As the language of the sutra is not English,people often ask if there is truly any value in reciting something we cannot understand. Certainly there is value in understanding the sutra’s meaning. In addition to the translation found in the back of this booklet, there are in-depth explanations available in various SGI publications. Studying such material can help us strengthen our understanding of and commitment to the Law.But intellectual understanding without practice is of no use. Moreover, we cannot comprehend the real depth of the teachings through reason alone.",
                  "Birds have their own language,their own speech. People don’t understand it, but other birds do.There are many examples among humans as well—codes, jargon, or foreign languages are well understood by experts or native speakers but unintelligible to others.",
                  "and heartfelt thoughts while performing the prayers that are important.",
                  "According to the principle of three thousand realms in a single moment of life, our wholehearted prayer is powerful enough to bring forth the protective forces innate in our lives and the environment. The first prayer, preceded by chanting Nam-myohorenge-kyo three times, is offered only in the morning before reciting the sutra. It expresses our appreciation for and empowers the functions of life and the universe that serve to protect us as a result of our Buddhist practice.",
                  "The second prayer expresses appreciation to the Gohonzon, the true object of devotion; to Nichiren Daishonin, the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law; and to Nikko Shonin, his immediate successor. For practitioners of Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism, these three represent the three treasures of Buddhism: the Law, the Buddha and the Buddhist Order, or community of believers, respectively. In addition, we offer appreciation for Nichimoku Shonin, Nikko’s successor, as representing practitioners who inherit the teaching into the future. In addition, we pray to repay our debts of gratitude to these teachers. In Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism, repaying such debts of gratitude means dedicating ourselves to Buddhist practice and attaining enlightenment.",
                  "The third prayer is focused on the attainment of kosen-rufu,the widespread propagation of the Mystic Law, which will bring about peace in society and in nature.We also pray for the continual advancement of the SGI, which is the community of believers sharing Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism throughout the world.We also express our appreciation for the three founding presidents, for their example as leaders of deep faith and commitment.",
                  "Our personal prayers are offered during the fourth prayer, along with our determination to bring forth Buddhahood and change our negative karma. Our chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and recitation of the sutra reach beyond the limits of time and space and affect the life of the entire universe, as indicated in our prayers for the deceased and prayers for the happiness of all humanity.",
                  "The second, third and fourth prayers are offered morning and evening at the conclusion of the sutra recitation and chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo."
